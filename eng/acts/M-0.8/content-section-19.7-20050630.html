However, the member who made the determination or the appeal panel, after considering any representations made by the parties, may grant a stay of a decision under subsection 19.2(1) to suspend or cancel a designation until the reconsideration is concluded, if the member or panel is satisfied that granting a stay would not constitute a threat to marine transportation security.</p><div class="HistoricalNote"><ul class="HistoricalNote"><li class="HistoricalNoteSubItem">2001, c. 29, s. 57</li></ul></div>

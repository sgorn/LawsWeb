If the Attorney General so requires, a judge or provincial court judge has no jurisdiction to try the accused under this Part and a preliminary inquiry must be held if requested under subsection 536(4), unless one has already been held or the re-election was made under subsection 565(2).</p><div class="HistoricalNote"><ul class="HistoricalNote"><li class="HistoricalNoteSubItem">R.S., 1985, c.

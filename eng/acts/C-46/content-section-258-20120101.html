section 253 or subsection 254(5) or in any proceedings under any of subsections 255(2) to (3.2),</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Paragraph"><span class="lawlabel">(a)</span> where it is proved that the accused occupied the seat or position ordinarily occupied by a person who operates a motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft or any railway equipment or who assists in the operation of an aircraft or of railway equipment, the accused shall be deemed to have had the care or control of the vehicle, vessel, aircraft or railway equipment, as the case may be, unless the accused establishes that the accused did not occupy that seat or position for the purpose of setting the vehicle, vessel, aircraft or railway equipment in motion or assisting in the operation of the aircraft or railway equipment, as the case may be;</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph"><span class="lawlabel">(b)</span> the result of an analysis of a sample of the accused’s breath, blood, urine or other bodily substance — other than a sample taken under subsection 254(3), (3.3) or (3.4) — may be admitted in evidence even if the accused was not warned before they gave the sample that they need not give the sample or that the result of the analysis of the sample might be used in evidence;</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph"><span class="lawlabel">(c)</span> where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3), if</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Subparagraph"><span class="lawlabel">(i)</span> [Repealed before coming into force, 2008, c. 20, s.

technician,</p></li></ul><p class="ContinuedParagraph">evidence of the results of the analyses so made is conclusive proof that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood both at the time when the analyses were made and at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was, if the results of the analyses are the same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, if the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations determined by the analyses, in the absence of evidence tending to show all of the following three things — that the approved instrument was malfunctioning or was operated improperly, that the malfunction or improper operation resulted in the determination that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood, and that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood would not in fact have exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed;</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph"><span class="lawlabel">(d)</span> if a sample of the accused’s blood has been taken under subsection 254(3) or section 256 or with the

sample of the blood of the accused and one of the samples was retained to permit an analysis of it to be made by or on behalf of the accused and, in the case where the accused makes a request within six months from the taking of the samples, one of the samples was ordered to be released under subsection (4),</p></li><li><p class="Subparagraph"><span class="lawlabel">(ii)</span> both samples referred to in subparagraph (i) were taken as soon as practicable and in any event not later than two hours after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed,</p></li><li><p

qualified medical practitioner,</p></li><li><p class="Subparagraph"><span class="lawlabel">(iv)</span> both samples referred to in subparagraph (i) were received from the accused directly into, or placed directly into, approved containers that were subsequently sealed, and</p></li><li><p class="Subparagraph"><span class="lawlabel">(v)</span> an analysis was made by an analyst of at least one of the samples,</p></li></ul><p class="ContinuedParagraph">evidence of the result of the analysis is conclusive proof that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood both at the time when the samples were taken and at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was the concentration determined by the analysis or, if more than one sample was analyzed and the results of the analyses are the same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, if the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations determined by the analyses, in the absence of evidence tending to show all of the following three things — that the analysis was performed improperly, that the improper performance resulted in the determination that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood, and that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood would not in fact have exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood at

of the results of the analyses is proof that the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of

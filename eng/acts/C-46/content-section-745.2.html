Do you wish to make any recommendation with respect to the number of years that the accused must serve before the accused is eligible for release on parole? You are not required to make any recommendation but if you do, your recommendation will be considered by me when I am determining whether I should substitute for the ten year period, which the law would otherwise require the accused to serve before the accused is eligible to be considered for release on parole, a number of years that is more than ten but not more than twenty-five.</p><div class="HistoricalNote"><ul class="HistoricalNote"><li class="HistoricalNoteSubItem">1995, c. 22, s. 6</li></ul></div>

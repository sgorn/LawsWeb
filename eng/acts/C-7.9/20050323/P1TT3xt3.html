For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the earnings attributable to the alienation of such immovable property situated in Canada as may be taxed by Canada under the provisions of Article 6 or paragraph 1 of Article 14 of the Agreement, and the profits, including any gains attributable to a permanent establishment in Canada in a year and previous years, after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits in Canada.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0" id="164953">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, duly authorised to that effect, by their respective Governments, have signed this Agreement.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="164954">DONE at Muscat, on this 30th day of June 2004, corresponding to 12/05/1425 AH, in two identical originals each in the English, French and Arabic languages, all texts being equally authoritative.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="164955">FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA</p><div class="FlushLeft">Roderick L.

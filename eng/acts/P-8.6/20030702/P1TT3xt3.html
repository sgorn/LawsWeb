The Limiting Collection principle (Clause 4.4) requires an organization to collect only that information necessary for the purposes that have been identified.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417681"><strong>4.2.3</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417682">The identified purposes should be specified at or before the time of collection to the individual from whom the personal information is collected. Depending upon the way in which the information is collected, this can be done orally or in writing. An application form, for example, may give notice of the purposes.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417683"><strong>4.2.4</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417684">When personal information that has been collected is to be used for a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose shall be identified prior to use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, the consent of the individual is required before information can be used for that purpose. For an elaboration on consent, please refer to the Consent principle (Clause 4.3).</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417685"><strong>4.2.5</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417686">Persons collecting personal information should be able to explain to individuals the purposes for which the information is being collected.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417687"><strong>4.2.6</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417688">This principle is linked closely to the Limiting Collection principle (Clause 4.4) and the Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention principle (Clause 4.5).</p><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">4.3 Principle 3 - Consent</h2><p class="indent-0-0" id="417690">The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.</p><p>Note: In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used, or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being collected for the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement, seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information. Seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when the individual is a minor, seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated. In addition, organizations that do not have a direct relationship with the individual may not always be able to seek consent. For example, seeking consent may be impractical for a charity or a direct-marketing firm that wishes to acquire a mailing list from another organization. In such cases, the organization providing the list would be expected to obtain consent before disclosing personal information.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417692"><strong>4.3.1</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417693">Consent is required for the collection of personal information and the subsequent use or disclosure of this information. Typically, an organization will seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when an organization wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified).</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417694"><strong>4.3.2</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417695">The principle requires “knowledge and consent”. Organizations shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the individual is advised of the purposes for which the information will be used. To make the consent meaningful, the purposes must be stated in such a manner that the individual can reasonably understand how the information will be used or disclosed.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417696"><strong>4.3.3</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417697">An organization shall not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfil the explicitly specified, and legitimate purposes.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417698"><strong>4.3.4</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417699">The form of the consent sought by the organization may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of information. In determining the form of consent to use, organizations shall take into account the sensitivity of the information. Although some information (for example, medical records and income records) is almost always considered to be sensitive, any information can be sensitive, depending on the context. For example, the names and addresses of subscribers to a newsmagazine would generally not be considered sensitive information. However, the names and addresses of subscribers to some special-interest magazines might be considered sensitive.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417700"><strong>4.3.5</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417701">In obtaining consent, the reasonable expectations of the individual are also relevant. For example, an individual buying a subscription to a magazine should reasonably expect that the organization, in addition to using the individual’s name and address for mailing and billing purposes, would also contact the person to solicit the renewal of the subscription. In this case, the organization can assume that the individual’s request constitutes consent for specific purposes. On the other hand, an individual would not reasonably expect that personal information given to a health-care professional would be given to a company selling health-care products, unless consent were obtained. Consent shall not be obtained through deception.</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417702"><strong>4.3.6</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417703">The way in which an organization seeks consent may vary, depending on the circumstances and the type of information collected. An organization should generally seek express consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent would generally be appropriate when the information is less sensitive. Consent can also be given by an authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney).</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417704"><strong>4.3.7</strong></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="417705">Individuals can give consent in many ways. For example:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="417706"><span class="lawlabel">(a)</span> an application form may be used to seek consent, collect information, and inform the individual of the use that will be made of the information.

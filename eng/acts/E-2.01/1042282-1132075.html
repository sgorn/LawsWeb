The returning officer or special voting rules administrator, unless he or she considers that it would not be in the public interest to do so, shall grant the application and shall not reveal the addresses in respect of which the application is made except as required to send the special ballot to the elector. For greater certainty, the granting of the application does not change the elector’s place of ordinary residence for the purposes of this Act.</p></li></ul></div></section></div></li><li><div class="hiddenMsg">The following provision is not in force.</div><div class="nif"><p class="MarginalNote"><span class="wb-invisible">Marginal note:</span><span class="HistoricalNote">2014, c. 12, s. 59</span></p><p class="Subsection amending" id="1042287"><span class="lawlabel">(3)</span> Subsection 233(3) of the Act is repealed.</p></div></li></ul></div></div></section>

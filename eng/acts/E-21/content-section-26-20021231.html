this section, the value of an expropriated interest is the market value thereof, that is to say, the amount that would have been paid for the interest if, at the time of its taking, it had been sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.</p></li><li><p class="MarginalNote"><span class="wb-invisible">Marginal note:</span>Where owner required to give up occupation</p><p

the expropriation, it has been necessary for him to give up occupation of the land, the value of the expropriated interest is the greater of</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Paragraph"><span

the time of its taking was its highest and best use, and</p></li><li><p class="Subparagraph"><span class="lawlabel">(ii)</span> the costs, expenses and losses arising out of or incidental to the owner’s disturbance, including moving to other premises, but if those costs, expenses and losses cannot practically be estimated or determined, there may be allowed in lieu thereof a percentage, not

purpose, and</p></li><li><p class="Subparagraph"><span class="lawlabel">(ii)</span> the cost, expenses and losses arising out of or incidental to moving to and re-establishment on other premises, but if those costs, expenses and losses cannot practically be estimated or determined, there may be allowed in lieu thereof a percentage, not exceeding fifteen, of the cost determined under subparagraph

humanitarian assistance efforts, and have other severe consequences that can persist for many years after use,</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="400001"><em>Deeply concerned</em> also at the dangers

restricting or suspending the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions,</p><p class="indent-0-0" id="400014"><em>Stressing</em> the role of public conscience in furthering the principles of humanity as evidenced by the global call for an end to civilian suffering caused by cluster munitions and <em>recognizing</em> the efforts to that end undertaken by the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and numerous other non-governmental organizations around the world,</p><p class="indent-0-0"

that in the conduct of military operations constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects and that the civilian population and individual civilians enjoy

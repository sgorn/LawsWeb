Such replacement gas will be treated as hydrocarbons in transit for purposes of the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America concerning Transit Pipelines, hereinafter referred to as “the Transit Pipeline Treaty”.

Except for fuel and except for Zone 11 (the Dawson-Whitehorse portion of the Dempster Line), the cost of service to each shipper in each zone will be determined on the basis of volumes as set forth in transportation contracts. The volumes used to assign these costs will reflect the original BTU content of Alaskan gas for U.S. shippers and Northern Canadian gas for Canadian shippers, and will make allowance for the change in heat content as the result of commingling. Each shipper will provide volumes for line losses and line pack in proportion to the contracted volumes transported in the zone. Each shipper will provide fuel requirements in relation to the volume of his gas being carried and to the content of the gas as it affects fuel consumption.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366573"><span class="lawlabel">(b)</span> It is understood that, to avoid increased construction and operating costs for the transportation of Alaskan gas, the Pipeline will follow a southern route through the Yukon along the Alaska Highway rather than a northern route through Dawson City and along the Klondike Highway. In order to provide alternative benefits for the transportation of Canadian gas to replace those benefits that would have been provided by the northern route through Dawson City, U.S. shippers will participate in the cost of service in Zone 11. It is agreed that if cost overruns on construction of the Pipeline in Canada do not exceed filed costs set forth in Part (iii)<a href="#fn_N-26_EN_hq_5106" id="fn_N-26_EN_hq_5106-ID0EBBCALHA"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span><sup>*</sup></a> of Annex III by more than 35 percent, U.S. shippers will pay the full cost of service in Zone 11.

The proportion of the cost of service borne by U.S. shippers in Zone 11 will be reduced should overruns on the cost of construction in that Zone exceed 35 percent after allowance for the benefits to U.S. shippers derived from Pipeline construction cost savings in other Zones. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the minimum, the U.S. shippers’ share will be the greater of either two-thirds of the cost of service or the proportion of contracted Alaskan gas in relation to all contracted gas carried in the Pipeline.

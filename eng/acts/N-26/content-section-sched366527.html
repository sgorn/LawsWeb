It is contemplated that this capacity will be 2.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) for Alaska gas and 1.2 bcfd for Northern Canadian gas. At such time as a lateral pipeline transmitting Northern Canadian gas, hereinafter referred to as “the Dempster Line”, is to be connected to the Pipeline or at any time additional pipeline capacity is needed to meet the contractual requirements of United States or Canadian shippers, the required authorizations will be provided, subject to regulatory requirements, to expand the capacity of the Pipeline in an efficient manner to meet those contractual requirements.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366544"><span class="lawlabel">(b)</span> The shippers on the Pipeline will, upon demonstration that an amount of Canadian gas equal on a British Thermal Unit (BTU) replacement value basis will be made available for contemporaneous export to the United States, make available from Alaska gas transmitted through the Pipeline, gas to meet the needs of remote users in the Yukon and in the provinces through which the Pipeline passes. Such replacement gas will be treated as hydrocarbons in transit for purposes of the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America concerning Transit Pipelines, hereinafter referred to as “the Transit Pipeline Treaty”. The shippers on the Pipeline will not incur any cost for provision of such Alaska gas except those capital costs arising from the following provisions:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366545"><span class="lawlabel">(i)</span> the owner of the Pipeline in the Yukon will make arrangements to provide gas to the communities of Beaver Creek, Burwash Landing, Destruction Bay, Haines Junction, Whitehorse, Teslin, Upper Liard and Watson Lake at a total cost to the owner of the Pipeline not to exceed Canadian $2.5 million;</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366546"><span class="lawlabel">(ii)</span> the owner of the Pipeline in the Yukon will make arrangements to provide gas to such other remote communities in the Yukon as may request such gas within a period of two years following commencement of operation of the Pipeline at a cost to the owner not to exceed the product of Canadian $2,500 and the number of customers in the communities, to a maximum total cost of Canadian $2.5 million.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-0-0" id="366547"><span class="lawlabel">4</span> <em>Financing</em></p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366548"><span class="lawlabel">(a)</span> It is understood that the construction of the Pipeline will be privately financed. Both Governments recognize that the companies owning the Pipeline in each country will have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the United States or the Canadian Government, as applicable, that protections against risks of non-completion and interruption are on a basis acceptable to that Government before proof of financing is established and construction allowed to begin.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366549"><span class="lawlabel">(b)</span> The two Governments recognize the importance of constructing the Pipeline in a timely way and under effective cost controls. Therefore, the return on the equity investment in the Pipeline will be based on a variable rate of return for each company owning a segment of the Pipeline, designed to provide incentives to avoid cost overruns and to minimize costs consistent with sound pipeline management. The base for the incentive program used for establishing the appropriate rate of return will be the capital costs used in measuring cost overruns as set forth in Annex III.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366550"><span class="lawlabel">(c)</span> It is understood that debt instruments issued in connection with the financing of the Pipeline in Canada will not contain any provision, apart from normal trust indenture restrictions generally applicable in the pipeline industry, which would prohibit, limit or inhibit the financing of the construction of the Dempster Line; nor will the variable rate of return provisions referred to in subparagraph (b) be continued to the detriment of financing the Dempster Line.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-0-0"

Governments reiterate their commitments as set forth in the Transit Pipeline Treaty with respect to non-discriminatory taxation, and take note of the statements issued by the Governments of the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, attached hereto as Annex V, in which those Governments undertake to ensure adherence to the provisions of the Transit Pipeline Treaty with respect to non-interference with throughput and to non-discriminatory treatment with respect to taxes, fees or other monetary charges on either the Pipeline or throughput.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366553"><span class="lawlabel">(b)</span> With respect to the Yukon Property Tax imposed on or for the use of the Pipeline the following principles apply:</p><ul

virtually exclusively, on the Pipeline, including taxes on gas used as compressor fuel, imposed by the Government of the Yukon Territory or any public authority therein on or for the use of the Pipeline, herein referred to as “the Yukon Property Tax”, will not exceed $30 million Canadian per year adjusted annually from 1983 by the Canadian Gross National Product price deflator as determined by Statistics Canada, hereinafter referred to as the GNP price deflator.</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366555"><span class="lawlabel">(ii)</span> For the period beginning January 1, 1980, and ending on December 31 of the year in which leave to open the Pipeline is granted by the appropriate regulatory authority, the Yukon Property Tax will not exceed the following:</p><ul

Canadian.</div></div></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366560"><span class="lawlabel">(iii)</span> The Yukon Property Tax formula described in subparagraph (i) will apply from January 1 after the year in which leave to open the Pipeline is granted by the appropriate regulatory authority until the date that is the earlier of the following, hereinafter called the tax termination date:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-3-3" id="366561"><span class="lawlabel">(A)</span> December 31, 2008, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-3-3" id="366562"><span

id="366563"><span class="lawlabel">(iv)</span> Subject to subparagraph (iii), if for the year ending on December 31, 1987, the percentage increase of the aggregate per capita revenue derived from all property tax levied by any public authority in the Yukon Territory (excluding the Yukon Property Tax) and grants to municipalities and Local Improvement Districts from the Government of the Yukon Territory, as compared to the aggregate per capita revenue derived from such sources for 1983, is greater than the percentage increase for 1987 of the Yukon Property Tax as compared to the Yukon Property Tax for 1983, the maximum level of the Yukon Property Tax for 1987 may be increased to equal the amount it would have reached had it increased over the period at the same rate as the aggregate per capita revenue.</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366564"><span class="lawlabel">(v)</span> If for any year in the period commencing January 1, 1988, and ending on the tax termination date, the annual percentage increase of the aggregate per capita revenue derived from all property tax levied by any public authority in the Yukon Territory (excluding the Yukon Property Tax) and grants to municipalities and Local Improvement Districts from the Government of the Yukon Territory as compared to the aggregate per capita revenue derived from such sources for the immediately preceding year exceeds the percentage increase for that year of the Yukon Property Tax as compared to the Yukon Property Tax for the immediately preceding year, the maximum level of the Yukon Property Tax for that year may be adjusted by the percentage increase of the aggregate per capita revenue in place of the percentage increase that otherwise might apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366565"><span class="lawlabel">(vi)</span> The provisions of subparagraph (i) will apply to the value of the Pipeline for the capacities contemplated in this Agreement. The Yukon Property Tax will increase for the additional facilities beyond the aforesaid contemplated capacity in direct proportion to the increase in the gross asset value of the Pipeline.</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366566"><span class="lawlabel">(vii)</span> In the event that between the date of this Agreement and January 1, 1983, the rate of the Alaska property tax on pipelines, taking into account the mill rate and the method of valuation, increases by a percentage greater than the cumulative percentage increase in the Canadian GNP deflator over the same period, there may be an adjustment on January 1, 1983, to the amount of $30 million Canadian described in subparagraph (i) of the Yukon Property Tax to reflect this difference. In defining the Alaska property tax for purposes of this Agreement, the definition of the Yukon Property Tax will apply <span class="otherLang" lang="la">mutatis mutandis</span>.</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366567"><span class="lawlabel">(viii)</span> In the event that, for any year during the period described in subparagraph (iii), the annual rate of the Alaska property tax on or for the use of the Pipeline in Alaska increases by a percentage over that imposed for the immediate preceding year that is greater than the increase in percentage of the Yukon Property Tax for the year, as adjusted, from that applied to the immediately preceding year, the Yukon Property Tax may be increased to reflect the percentage increase of the Alaska property tax.</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2" id="366568"><span class="lawlabel">(ix)</span> It is understood that indirect socio-economic costs in the Yukon Territory will not be reflected in the cost of service to the United States shippers other than through the Yukon Property Tax. It is further understood that no public authority will require creation of a special fund or funds in connection with construction of the Pipeline in the Yukon, financed in a manner which is reflected in the cost of service to U.S. shippers, other than through the Yukon Property Tax. However, should public authorities in the State of Alaska require creation of a special fund or funds, financed by contributions not fully reimbursable, in connection with construction of the Pipeline in Alaska, the Governments of Canada or the Yukon Territory will have the right to take similar action.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366569"><span class="lawlabel">(c)</span> The Government of Canada will use its best endeavors to ensure that the level of any property tax imposed by the Government of the Northwest Territories on or for the use of that part of the Dempster Line that is within the Northwest Territories is reasonably comparable to the level of the property tax imposed by the Government of the Yukon Territory on or for the use of that part of the Dempster Line that is in the Yukon.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-0-0" id="366570"><span class="lawlabel">6.</span> <em>Tariffs and Cost Allocation</em></p><p class="indent-0-0" id="366571">It is agreed that the following principles will apply for purposes of cost allocation used in determining the cost of service applicable to each shipper on the Pipeline in Canada:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366572"><span class="lawlabel">(a)</span> The Pipeline in Canada and the Dempster Line will be divided into zones as set forth in Annex II. Except for fuel and except for Zone 11 (the Dawson-Whitehorse portion of the Dempster Line), the cost of service to each shipper in each zone will be determined on the basis of volumes as set forth in transportation contracts. The volumes used to assign these costs will reflect the original BTU content of Alaskan gas for U.S. shippers and Northern Canadian gas for Canadian shippers, and will make allowance for the change in heat content as the result of commingling. Each shipper will provide volumes for line losses and line pack in proportion to the contracted volumes transported in the zone. Each shipper will provide fuel requirements in relation to the volume of his gas being carried and to the content of the gas as it affects fuel consumption.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366573"><span class="lawlabel">(b)</span> It is understood that, to avoid increased construction and operating costs for the transportation of Alaskan gas, the Pipeline will follow a southern route through the Yukon along the Alaska Highway rather than a northern route through Dawson City and along the Klondike Highway. In order to provide alternative benefits for the transportation of Canadian gas to replace those benefits that would have been provided by the northern route through Dawson City, U.S. shippers will participate in the cost of service in Zone 11. It is agreed that if cost overruns on construction of the Pipeline in Canada do not exceed filed costs set forth in Part (iii)<a href="#fn_N-26_EN_hq_5106" id="fn_N-26_EN_hq_5106-ID0EBBCALHA"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span><sup>*</sup></a> of Annex III by more than 35 percent, U.S. shippers will pay the full cost of service in Zone 11. U.S. shipper participation will decline if overruns on the Pipeline in Canada exceed 35 percent; however at the minimum the U.S. shippers’ share will be the greater of either two-thirds of the cost of service or the proportion of contracted Alaskan gas in relation to all contracted gas carried in the Pipeline. The proportion of the cost of service borne by U.S. shippers in Zone 11 will be reduced should overruns on the cost of construction in that Zone exceed 35 percent after allowance for the benefits to U.S. shippers derived from Pipeline construction cost savings in other Zones. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the minimum, the U.S. shippers’ share will be the greater of either two-thirds of the cost of service or the proportion of contracted Alaskan gas in relation to all contracted gas carried in the Pipeline. Details of this allocation of cost of service are set out in Annex III.</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><div class="Footnote"><p class="Footnote"><a href="#fn_N-26_EN_hq_5106-ID0EBBCALHA" id="fn_N-26_EN_hq_5106"><span class="wb-invisible">Return to footnote </span><sup>*</sup></a>In subparagraph 6(b), the words “Part (iii) of Annex III” were substituted for the words “Part D of Annex III” in accordance with an exchange of notes dated June 6, 1978 between the Governments of Canada and the United States of America.</p></div></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366574"><span class="lawlabel">(c)</span> Notwithstanding the principles in subparagraphs (a) and (b), in the event that the total volume of gas offered for shipment exceeds the efficient capacity of the Pipeline, the method of cost allocation for the cost of service for shipments of Alaskan gas (minimum entitlement 2.4 bcfd) or Northern Canadian gas (minimum entitlement 1.2 bcfd) in excess of the efficient capacity of the Pipeline will be subject to review and subsequent agreement by both Governments; provided however that shippers of either country may transport additional volumes without such review and agreement, but subject to appropriate regulatory approval, if such transportation does not lead to a higher cost of service or share of Pipeline fuel requirements attributable to shippers of the other country.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="366575"><span class="lawlabel">(d)</span> It is agreed that Zone 11 costs of service allocated to U.S. shippers will not include costs additional to those attributable to a pipe size of 42 inches.

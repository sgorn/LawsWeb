maintain and operate a bridge across the Niagara River between the city of Buffalo, in the state of New York, and the village (now the town) of Fort Erie, in the province of Ontario, and by agreement dated thirteenth day of June, 1925, the said two companies were amalgamated and consolidated so as to form one and a new single company under the same name in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the said Acts of incorporation; and whereas for the purpose of the reorganization and refinancing of the said bridge undertaking upon a basis which will permit of a considerable reduction of fixed charges and consequent reduction of tolls now charged, by an Act of the Legislature of the state of New York, being chapter eight hundred and twenty-four of the laws of the said state for 1933, (hereinafter called “Act of Incorporation”, and a copy of which is, for the information only of Parliament, attached as a Schedule hereto), a Board, known as the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority, was created a body corporate and politic, constituting a public benefit corporation, with power to acquire, hold and manage the property and assets of the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Company; and whereas by the Act of Incorporation it is provided that the said Board shall consist of nine members, six of whom are required to be citizens of the United States and residents of the state of New York, to be appointed and removed by the Governor of the said state, and three of whom are required to be residents of the Dominion of Canada, to be appointed and removed

assets used, risks assumed and activities performed by the permanent establishment. The principles of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines shall apply for purposes of determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment, taking into account the different economic and legal circumstances of a single entity. Accordingly, any of the methods described therein as acceptable methods for determining an arm’s length result may be used to determine the income of a permanent establishment so long as those methods are applied in accordance with the Guidelines. In particular, in determining the amount of attributable profits, the permanent establishment shall be treated as having the same amount of capital that it would need to support its activities if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities. With respect to financial institutions other than insurance companies, a Contracting State may determine the amount of capital to be attributed to a permanent establishment by allocating the institution’s total equity between its various offices on the basis of the proportion of the financial institution’s risk-weighted assets attributable to each of them. In the case of an insurance company, there shall be attributed to a permanent establishment not only premiums earned through the permanent establishment, but that portion of the insurance company’s overall investment income from reserves and surplus that supports the risks assumed by the permanent establishment.</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-0-0" id="59478"><span class="lawlabel">10</span> <em>Qualifying retirement plans</em></p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0" id="59479">For purposes of paragraph 15 of Article XVIII (Pensions and Annuities) of the Convention, it is understood that</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="59480"><span class="lawlabel">(a)</span> In the case of Canada, the term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>qualifying retirement plan</dfn></span> shall include the following and any identical or substantially similar plan that is established pursuant to legislation introduced after the date of signature of the Protocol: registered pension plans under section 147.1 of the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-3.3">Income Tax Act</a></cite>, registered retirement savings plans under section 146 that are part of a group arrangement described in subsection 204.2(1.32), deferred profit sharing plans under section 147, and any registered retirement savings plan under section 146 or registered retirement income fund under section 146.3 that is funded exclusively by rollover contributions from one or more of the preceding plans; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1" id="59481"><span class="lawlabel">(b)</span> In the case of the United States, the term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>qualifying retirement plan</dfn></span> shall include the following and any identical or substantially similar plan that is established pursuant to legislation introduced after the date of signature of the Protocol: qualified plans under section 401(a) of the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Internal Revenue Code</cite> (including section 401(k) arrangements), individual retirement plans that are part of a simplified employee pension plan that satisfies section 408(k), section 408(p) simple retirement accounts, section 403(a) qualified annuity plans, section 403(b) plans, section 457(g) trusts providing benefits under section 457(b) plans, the Thrift Savings Fund (section 7701(j)), and any individual retirement account under section 408(a) that is funded exclusively by rollover contributions from one or more of the preceding plans.</p></li></ul><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-0-0" id="59482"><span class="lawlabel">11</span> <em>Former long-term residents</em></p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0" id="59483">The term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>long-term resident</dfn></span> shall mean any individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States in eight or more taxable years during the preceding 15 taxable years.

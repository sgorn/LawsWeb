	<li>“Polymer / Biopolymer and reduced regulatory requirement polymer” (oval shape) leads to “30 days before exceeding 1000 kg per year (Reference to Section 10)” (Diamond shape) that leads to “Schedule 9” [Footnote 1: Required for polymers / biopolymers including reduced regulatory requirement polymers. Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the polymer is a biopolymer – see paragraph 10(b)] (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 9, at least 30 days before exceeding 1000 kg per year of the polymer / biopolymer and reduced regulatory requirement polymer.</li>
	<li>“Schedule 9” leads to three different situations: “No additional requirements for reduced regulatory requirement polymers” or “Specified on the NDSL or all of whose reactants are specified on the DSL” or NDSL (Reference to Section 11)” or “Not specified on the NDSL and one or more reactants are not specified on either the DSL or NDSL (Reference to Section 12)”:<ol class="lowerAlpha">
	<li>“No additional requirements for reduced regulatory requirement polymers” - Manufacturer or importer doesn’t have to provide additional information.</li>
	<li>“Specified on the NDSL or all of whose reactants are specified on the DSL or NDSL (Reference to Section 11)” (Rectangle shape) – Contains the following two requirements that manufacturers and importers must meet according to the situation:<ol class="lowerRoman">
		<li>“60 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year” (Diamond shape) leads to “Schedule 10” [Footnote 2: Not required for reduced regulatory requirement polymers. Also subject to certain exceptions – see subsection 11(5). Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the polymer is a biopolymer - see subparagraph 11(1)(b). No further information will be required unless: (a) the polymer is released to the aquatic environment in a quantity exceeding 3 kg per day, per site, averaged monthly and after wastewater treatment – see subsection 11(2) – or (b) the public may be significantly exposed to the polymer in a product – see subsection 11(3)] (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 10, at least 60 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year of the substance.</li>
		<li>“60 days before exceeding 50000 kg per year” (Diamond shape outlined with a broken line) leads to “If releases exceed 3 kg per day per site” [Rectangle shape outlined with a broken line that contains: “Additional information set out in subsection 11(2)” (Rectangle shape)] or leads to “If significant public exposure” [Rectangle shape outlined with a broken line that contains: “Additional information set out in subsection 11(3)” (Rectangle shape)] – Manufacturers and importers need to provide additional information set out in subsection 11(2) if releases exceed 3 kg per day per site or additional information set out in subsection 11(3) if significant public exposure occur, at least 60 days before exceeding 50000 kg per year of the substance.</li></ol></li>
	<li>“Not specified on the NDSL and one or more reactants are not specified on either the DSL or NDSL (Reference to Section 12)” – Contains the following requirement that manufacturers and importers must provide according to the situation:<ol class="lowerRoman">
		<li>“60 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year” (Diamond shape) leads to “Schedule 11” [Footnote 3: Not required for reduced regulatory requirement polymers. Also subject to certain exceptions – see subsection 12(3). Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the polymer is a biopolymer - see paragraph 12(1)(b)] (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 11, at least 60 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year of the substance.</li>

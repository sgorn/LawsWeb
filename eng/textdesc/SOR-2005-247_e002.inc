<p>"Chemical / Biochemical" (oval shape) – Accordingly of the type of substance, it leads to two different processes: "Specified on the NDSL (Reference to Section 7)" or "Not specified on the NDSL (Reference to Section 8)":</p>

<ol class="lowerAlpha">
	<li>"Specified on the NDSL (Reference to Section 7)" (Rectangle shape) – Contains the following three requirements that manufacturers and importers must meet, according to the situation:<ol class="lowerRoman">
		<li>"30 days before exceeding 1000 kg per year" (Diamond shape) leads to "Schedule 4 [Footnote 1: Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the chemical is a biochemical - see subparagraph 7(1)(a)(ii)]" (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 4, at least 30 days before exceeding 1000 kg per year of the substance.</li>
		<li>"60 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year" (Diamond shape) leads to "Schedule 5" [Footnote 2: Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the chemical is a biochemical - see subparagraph 7(1)(b)(ii). No further information will be required unless: (a) the chemical is released to the aquatic environment in a quantity exceeding 3 kg per day, per site, averaged monthly and after wastewater treatment – see subsection 7(2) – or (b) the public may be significantly exposed to the chemical in a product – see subsection 7(3)] (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 5, at least 60 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year of the substance.</li>
		<li>"75 days before exceeding 50000 kg per year" (Diamond shape outlined with a broken line) leads to "If releases exceed 3 kg per day per site" [Rectangle shape outlined with a broken line that contains: "Additional information set out in subsection 7(2)" (Rectangle shape)] and/or leads to "If significant public exposure" [Rectangle shape outlined with a broken line that contains: "Additional information set out in subsection 7(3)" (Rectangle shape)] – Manufacturers and importers need to provide additional information set out in subsection 7(2) if releases exceed 3 kg per day per site or additional information set out in subsection 7(3) if significant public exposure occur, at least 75 days before exceeding 50000 kg per year of the substance.</li>

	<li>"Not specified on the NDSL (Reference to Section 8)" [Footnote 3: Notification must be sent to the Minister if: the chemical or biochemical is specified on the NDSL following submission of the information referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(b)(i) and item 10 of Schedule 5 – see subsection 8(2)] (Rectangle shape) – Contains the following three requirements that manufacturers and importers must meet according to the situation:<ol class="lowerRoman">
		<li>"5 days before exceeding 100 kg per year" (Diamond shape) leads to "Schedule 4" [Footnote 4: Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the chemical is a biochemical - see subparagraph 8(1)(a)(ii), (b)(ii) and (c)(ii)] (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 4, at least 5 days before exceeding 100 kg per year of the substance.</li>
		<li>"60 days before exceeding 1000 kg per year" (Diamond shape) leads to "Schedule 5" [Footnote 4: Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the chemical is a biochemical - see subparagraph 8(1)(a)(ii), (b)(ii) and (c)(ii)] (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 4, at least 5 days before exceeding 100 kg per year of the substance.</li>
		<li>"75 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year" (Diamond shape) leads to "Schedule 6" [Footnote 4: Additional information specified in Schedule 2 is also required if the chemical is a biochemical - see subparagraph 8(1)(a)(ii), (b)(ii) and (c)(ii)] (Rectangle shape) – Manufacturers and importers need to provide the information detailed in Schedule 6, at least 75 days before exceeding 10000 kg per year of the substance.</li>

<section class="summary"><h1 class="Summary">SUMMARY</h1><p class="indent-1-0">Part 1 enacts the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-6.9">Security of Canada Information Sharing Act</a></cite>, which authorizes Government of Canada institutions to disclose information to Government of Canada institutions that have jurisdiction or responsibilities in respect of activities that undermine the security of Canada. It also makes related amendments to other Acts.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 2 enacts the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-6.7">Secure Air Travel Act</a></cite> in order to provide a new legislative framework for identifying and responding to persons who may engage in an act that poses a threat to transportation security or who may travel by air for the purpose of committing a terrorism offence. That Act authorizes the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to establish a list of such persons and to direct air carriers to take a specific action to prevent the commission of such acts. In addition, that Act establishes powers and prohibitions governing the collection, use and disclosure of information in support of its administration and enforcement. That Act includes an administrative recourse process for listed persons who have been denied transportation in accordance with a direction from the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and provides appeal procedures for persons affected by any decision or action taken under that Act. That Act also specifies punishment for contraventions of listed provisions and authorizes the Minister of Transport to conduct inspections and issue compliance orders. Finally, this Part makes consequential amendments to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/A-2">Aeronautics Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-5">Canada Evidence Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-46">Criminal Code</a></cite> to, with respect to recognizances to keep the peace relating to a terrorist activity or a terrorism offence, extend their duration, provide for new thresholds, authorize a judge to impose sureties and require a judge to consider whether it is desirable to include in a recognizance conditions regarding passports and specified geographic areas. With respect to all recognizances to keep the peace, the amendments also allow hearings to be conducted by video conference and orders to be transferred to a judge in a territorial division other than the one in which the order was made and increase the maximum sentences for breach of those recognizances.</p><p class="indent-1-0">It further amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-46">Criminal Code</a></cite> to provide for an offence of knowingly advocating or promoting the commission of terrorism offences in general. It also provides a judge with the power to order the seizure of terrorist propaganda or, if the propaganda is in electronic form, to order the deletion of the propaganda from a computer system.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Finally, it amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-46">Criminal Code</a></cite> to provide for the increased protection of witnesses, in particular of persons who play a role in respect of proceedings involving security information or criminal intelligence information, and makes consequential amendments to other Acts.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 4 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-23">Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act</a></cite> to permit the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to take, within and outside Canada, measures to reduce threats to the security of Canada, including measures that are authorized by the Federal Court. It authorizes the Federal Court to make an assistance order to give effect to a warrant issued under that Act. It also creates new reporting requirements for the Service and requires the Security Intelligence Review Committee to review the Service’s performance in taking measures to reduce threats to the security of Canada.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 5 amends Divisions 8 and 9 of Part 1 of the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-2.5">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></cite> to, among other things,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) define obligations related to the provision of information in proceedings under that Division 9;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) authorize the judge, on the request of the Minister, to exempt the Minister from providing the special advocate with certain relevant information that has not been filed with the Federal Court, if the judge is satisfied that the information does not enable the person named in a certificate to be reasonably informed of the case made by the Minister, and authorize the judge to ask the special advocate to make submissions with respect to the exemption; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) allow the Minister to appeal, or to apply for judicial review of, any decision requiring the disclosure of information or other evidence if, in the Minister’s opinion, the disclosure would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person.</p></li></ul></section><div class="Enacts"><p class="indent-1-0">Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:</p></div><h1 class="Part" id="h-1"><span class="HTitleText1">SHORT TITLE</span></h1><!--#include file="content-section-1.html" --><h1 class="Part" id="h-2"><span class="HLabel1">PART 1</span><span class="HTitleText1"><cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-6.9">SECURITY OF CANADA INFORMATION SHARING ACT</a></cite></span></h1><h2 class="Subheading" id="h-3"><span class="HTitleText2">Enactment of Act</span></h2><!--#include file="content-section-2.html" --><h2 class="Subheading" id="h-4"><span class="HTitleText2">Related Amendments</span></h2><h3 class="Subheading" id="h-5"><span class="MarginalNoteInHeading">R.S., c.

of mobile equipment and associated rights.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. For the purposes of this Convention, an international interest in mobile equipment is an interest, constituted under Article 7, in a uniquely identifiable object of a category of such objects listed in paragraph 3 and designated in the Protocol:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) granted by the chargor under a security agreement;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) vested in a person who is the conditional seller under a title

sub-paragraph (<em>a</em>) does not also fall within sub-paragraph (<em>b</em>) or (<em>c</em>).</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The categories referred to in the preceding paragraphs are:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) airframes, aircraft engines and helicopters;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) railway rolling stock; and</p></li><li><p

(<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>) or (<em>c</em>) of that paragraph.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. An international interest in an object extends to proceeds of that object.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 3<br>Sphere of Application</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Convention applies when, at the time of the conclusion of the agreement creating or providing for the international interest, the debtor is situated in a Contracting State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The fact that the creditor is situated in a non-Contracting State does not affect the applicability of this Convention.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 4<br>Where Debtor Is Situated</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. For the purposes of Article 3(1), the debtor is situated in any Contracting State:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) under the law of which it is incorporated or

paragraph to the debtor’s place of business shall, if it has more than one place of business, mean its principal place of business or, if it has no place of business, its habitual residence.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 5<br>Interpretation and Applicable Law</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its purposes as set forth in the preamble, to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity and predictability in its application.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the applicable law.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. References to the applicable law are to the domestic rules of the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law of the forum State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where a State comprises several territorial units, each of which has its own rules of law in respect of the matter to be decided, and where there is no indication of the relevant territorial unit, the law of that State decides which is the territorial unit whose rules shall govern. In the absence of any such rule, the law of the territorial unit with which the case is most closely connected shall apply.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 6<br>Relationship Between the Convention and the Protocol</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Convention and the Protocol shall be read and interpreted together as a single instrument.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. To the extent of any inconsistency between this Convention and the Protocol, the Protocol shall prevail.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CHAPTER II<br>CONSTITUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 7<br>Formal Requirements</h3><p class="indent-1-0">An interest is constituted as an international interest under this Convention where the agreement creating or providing for the interest:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) is in writing;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) relates to an object of which the chargor, conditional seller or lessor has power to dispose;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) enables the object to be identified in conformity with the Protocol; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) in the case of a security agreement, enables the secured obligations to be determined, but without the need to state a sum or maximum sum secured.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CHAPTER III<br>DEFAULT REMEDIES</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br>Remedies of Chargee</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. In the event of default as provided in Article 11, the chargee may, to the extent that the chargor has at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, exercise any one or more of the following remedies:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) take possession or control of any object charged to it;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) sell or grant a lease of any such object;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) collect or receive any income or profits arising from the management or use of any such object.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The chargee may alternatively apply for a court order authorising or directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Any remedy set out in sub-paragraph (<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>) or (<em>c</em>) of paragraph 1 or by Article 13 shall be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner. A remedy shall be deemed to be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner where it is exercised in conformity with a provision of the security agreement except where such a provision is manifestly unreasonable.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. A chargee proposing to sell or grant a lease of an object under paragraph 1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the proposed sale or lease to:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interested persons specified in Article 1(<em>m</em>)(i) and (ii); and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interested persons specified in Article 1(<em>m</em>)(iii) who have given notice of their rights to the chargee within a reasonable time prior to the sale or lease.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result of exercise of any of the remedies set out in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be applied towards discharge of the amount of the secured obligations.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a result of the exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured by the security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of any such remedy, then unless otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall distribute the surplus among holders of subsequently ranking interests which have been registered or of which the chargee has been given notice, in order of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br>Vesting of Object in Satisfaction; Redemption</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. At any time after default as provided in Article 11, the chargee and all the interested persons may agree that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The court may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only if the amount of the secured obligations to be satisfied by such vesting is commensurate with the value of the object after taking account of any payment to be made by the chargee to any of the interested persons.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. At any time after default as provided in Article 11 and before sale of the charged object or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or any interested person may discharge the security interest by paying in full the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the chargee under Article 8(1)(<em>b</em>) or ordered under Article 8(2). Where, after such default, the payment of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the debtor, that person is subrogated to the rights of the chargee.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a sale under Article 8(1)(<em>b</em>) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article is free from any other interest over which the chargee’s security interest has priority under the provisions of Article 29.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Remedies of Conditional Seller or Lessor</h3><p class="indent-1-0">In the event of default under a title reservation agreement or under a leasing agreement as provided in Article 11, the conditional seller or the lessor, as the case may be, may:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, terminate the agreement and take possession or control of any object to which the agreement relates; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) apply for a court order authorising or directing either of these acts.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Meaning of Default</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The debtor and the creditor may at any time agree in writing as to the events that constitute a default or otherwise give rise to the rights and remedies specified in Articles 8 to 10 and 13.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Where the debtor and the creditor have not so agreed, “default” for the purposes of Articles 8 to 10 and 13 means a default which substantially deprives the creditor of what it is entitled to expect under the agreement.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 12<br>Additional Remedies</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Any additional remedies permitted by the applicable law, including any remedies agreed upon by the parties, may be exercised to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the mandatory provisions of this Chapter as set out in Article 15.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 13<br>Relief Pending Final Determination</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Subject to any declaration that it may make under Article 55, a Contracting State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) preservation of the object and its value;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) possession, control or custody of the object;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) immobilisation of the object; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (<em>a</em>) to (<em>c</em>), management of the object and the income therefrom.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In making any order under the preceding paragraph, the court may impose such terms as it considers necessary to protect the interested persons in the event that the creditor:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in implementing any order granting such relief, fails to perform any of its obligations to the debtor under this Convention or the Protocol; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) fails to establish its claim, wholly or in part, on the final determination of that claim.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Before making any order under paragraph 1, the court may require notice of the request to be given to any of the interested persons.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Nothing in this Article affects the application of Article 8(3) or limits the availability of forms of interim relief other than those set out in paragraph 1.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 14<br>Procedural Requirements</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Subject to Article 54(2), any remedy provided by this Chapter shall be exercised in conformity with the procedure prescribed by the law of the place where the remedy is to be exercised.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 15<br>Derogation</h3><p class="indent-1-0">In their relations with each other, any two or more of the parties referred to in this Chapter may at any time, by agreement in writing, derogate from or vary the effect of any of the preceding provisions of this Chapter except Articles 8(3) to (6), 9(3) and (4), 13(2) and 14.</p><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CHAPTER IV<br>THE INTERNATIONAL REGISTRATION SYSTEM</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 16<br>The International Registry</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. An International Registry shall be established for registrations of:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) international interests, prospective international interests and registrable non-consensual rights and interests;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) assignments and prospective assignments of international interests;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) acquisitions of international interests by legal or contractual subrogations under the applicable law;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) notices of national interests;

<section class="summary"><h1 class="Summary">SUMMARY</h1><p class="indent-0-0">This enactment enacts the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law)</cite> to provide for the taking of restrictive measures in respect of foreign nationals responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. It also proposes related amendments to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-14.5">Special Economic Measures Act</a></cite> and to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-2.5">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></cite>.</p></section><section class="order"><h6 id="preamble" class="MarginalNote">Preamble</h6><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas human rights and the rule of law are integral to international law and Canada has repeatedly asserted its commitment to promoting international justice and respect for human rights;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas signatory States to international human rights agreements have committed themselves to the obligations and responsibilities set out in those agreements;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas Sergei Magnitsky, a Moscow lawyer who uncovered the largest tax fraud in Russian history, was detained without trial, tortured and consequently died in a Moscow prison on November 16, 2009;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas no thorough, independent and objective investigation has been conducted by Russian authorities into the detention, torture and death of Sergei Magnitsky, nor have the individuals responsible been brought to justice;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas the unprecedented posthumous trial and conviction of Sergei Magnitsky in Russia for the very fraud he uncovered constitute a violation of the principles of fundamental justice and the rule of law;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas legislation and motions adopted by legislative assemblies in the United States, the European Parliament, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Canada have condemned the mistreatment of Sergei Magnitsky as “a violation of the principles of fundamental justice and the rule of law” and called for sanctions against any foreign nationals responsible for violations of internationally recognized human rights in a foreign country when authorities in that country are unable or unwilling to conduct a thorough, independent and objective investigation of the violations;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas the Litvinenko Inquiry report, presented to the United Kingdom Parliament on January 21, 2016, found that two Russian agents, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, were responsible for the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko and that there was a “strong possibility” that they were acting on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was assassinated outside the Kremlin on February 27, 2015, and to this day no thorough, independent and objective investigation has been conducted by Russian authorities;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas the Senate, on May 5, 2015, and the House of Commons, on March 25, 2015, by unanimous resolutions called upon the Government of Canada to explore and encourage sanctions against any foreign nationals responsible for the detention, torture and death of Sergei Magnitsky and to explore sanctions as appropriate against any foreign nationals responsible for violations of internationally recognized human rights in a foreign country, when authorities in that country are unable or unwilling to conduct a thorough, independent and objective investigation of the violations;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas member of the Ukrainian Parliament Lieutenant Nadiya Savchenko and other Ukrainians were illegally convicted and imprisoned in Russia in violation of international norms and fundamental justice;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-14.5">Special Economic Measures Act</a></cite> authorizes the Government of Canada to take economic measures against a foreign state or national for the purpose of implementing a decision, resolution or recommendation of an international organization or association of states, or in cases of a grave breach of international peace and security that resulted or is likely to result in a serious international crisis;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas adding gross violations of internationally recognized human rights as a ground on which sanctions may be imposed against foreign states and nationals would further Canada’s support for human rights and advance its responsibility to protect activists who fight for human rights;</p><p class="indent-0-0">Whereas it is important to acknowledge and remember Sergei Magnitsky’s sacrifice, as well as the sacrifice of other victims of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights;</p><p class="indent-0-0">And whereas all violators of internationally recognized human rights should be treated and sanctioned equally throughout the world,</p></section><div class="Enacts"><p class="indent-0-0">Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as

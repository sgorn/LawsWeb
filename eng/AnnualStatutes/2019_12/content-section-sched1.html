profits to locations where they are subject to non-taxation or reduced taxation;</p><p class="indent-1-0">Mindful that base erosion and profit shifting (hereinafter referred to as “BEPS”) is a pressing issue not only for industrialised countries but also for emerging economies and developing countries;</p><p class="indent-1-0">Recognising the importance of ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created;</p><p class="indent-1-0">Welcoming the package of measures developed under the OECD/G20 BEPS project (hereinafter referred to as the “OECD/G20 BEPS package”);</p><p class="indent-1-0">Noting that the OECD/G20 BEPS package included tax treaty-related measures to address certain hybrid mismatch arrangements, prevent treaty abuse, address artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status, and improve dispute resolution;</p><p class="indent-1-0">Conscious of the need to ensure swift, co-ordinated and consistent implementation of the treaty-related BEPS measures in a multilateral context;</p><p class="indent-1-0">Noting the need to ensure that existing agreements for the avoidance of double taxation on income are interpreted to eliminate double taxation with respect to the taxes covered by those agreements without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in those agreements for the indirect benefit of residents of third jurisdictions);</p><p class="indent-1-0">Recognising the need for an effective mechanism to implement agreed changes in a synchronised and efficient manner across the network of existing agreements for the avoidance of double taxation on income without the need to bilaterally renegotiate each such agreement;</p><p class="indent-1-0">Have agreed as follows:</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">PART

The judge shall take any measure that he or she considers appropriate.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Recount Teams</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The judge shall, with the Chief Electoral Officer’s approval, establish an appropriate number of recount teams, each consisting of two members appointed by the returning officer — one to have the responsibilities of handler and the other those of recorder — and one representative appointed by each candidate who wishes to be represented on the recount team. Each team is to be assigned a sequential team number, beginning with 1.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Process — General</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Each recount team shall be assigned to a table and shall remain at its table except during breaks as directed by the judge.

They clarify and expand the regulation making power relating to screening. They require air carriers or operators of aviation reservation systems to provide information concerning specified flights or persons. They also require them to provide information for transportation security purposes and national security purposes. They create a new offence concerning passengers who are unruly or who jeopardize the safety or security of an aircraft in flight. They provide a legislative basis for security clearances. They also authorize the making of regulations that require the establishment of security management systems by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority and by air carriers and operators of aerodromes and other aviation facilities.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 2 amends the definitions of <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“screening”</dfn></span> and <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“screening point”</dfn></span> in the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-11.2">Canadian Air Transport Security Authority Act</a></cite> to include emergency directions made under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/A-2">Aeronautics Act</a></cite>.

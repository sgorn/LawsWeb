<p>RECOMMENDATION</p><p class="indent-0-0">Her Excellency the Governor General recommends to the House of Commons the appropriation of public revenue under the circumstances, in the manner and for the purposes set out in a measure entitled “<cite class="XRefExternalAct">An Act to provide further support in response to COVID-19</cite>”.</p><section class="summary"><h1 class="Summary">SUMMARY</h1><p class="indent-0-0">Part 1 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-3.3">Income Tax Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalRegulation"><a href="/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945">Income Tax Regulations</a></cite> to extend subsidies under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS), and the Canada Recovery Hiring Program until May 7, 2022, as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Support under the CEWS and the CERS would be available to the tourism and hospitality sector and to the hardest-hit organizations that face significant revenue declines. Eligible entities under these rules would need to demonstrate a revenue decline over the course of 12 months of the pandemic, as well as a current-month revenue decline. In addition, organizations subject to a qualifying public health restriction would be eligible for support, if they have one or more locations subject to a public health restriction lasting for at least seven days that requires them to cease some or all of their activities. Part 1 also allows the government to extend the subsidies by regulation but no later than July 2, 2022.</p><p class="indent-0-0">Part 2 enacts the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit Act</cite> to authorize the payment of the Canada worker lockdown benefit in regions where a lockdown is imposed for reasons related to COVID-19.

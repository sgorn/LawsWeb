<section class="summary"><h1 class="Summary">SUMMARY</h1><p class="indent-1-0">This enactment replaces the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-9.01">Pest Control Products Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">The enactment provides a pest control product registration regime that gives the Minister of Health the necessary powers to ensure that pest control products are registered only if their risks and value are determined by the Minister to be acceptable.</p><p class="indent-1-0">The enactment provides further protection of health, safety and the environment by requiring that, after a product is registered, new information about risks and value be reported, by authorizing the special review and re-evaluation of registered pest control products and by giving inspectors power to take measures to prevent risks.</p><p class="indent-1-0">In addition, the enactment provides for public participation in the regulatory process by requiring that the public be consulted before significant registration decisions are made and by providing the public with the right to request and participate in the reconsideration of decisions. It also gives the public access to certain information provided in relation to registered pest control products.</p></section><section class="order"><h6 id="preamble" class="MarginalNote">Preamble</h6><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS the availability and use of pest control products pose potential risks, both directly and indirectly, to the health, safety and well-being of people in Canada and to the environment;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS pest management plays a significant role in diverse areas of the economy and other aspects of the quality of life throughout Canada;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS pest control products of acceptable risk and value can contribute significantly to the attainment of the goals of sustainable pest management;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS the goals of sustainable pest management are to meet societyâ€™s needs for human health protection, food and fibre production and resource utilization and to conserve or enhance natural resources and the quality of the environment for future generations, in an economically viable manner;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Canada and the provinces and territories have traditionally administered complementary regulatory systems designed to protect people and the environment, including its biological diversity, from unacceptable risks posed by pest control products, and it is important that such an approach be continued in order to achieve mutually desired results efficiently, without regulatory conflict or duplication;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS it is in the national interest thatthe primary objective of the federal regulatory system be to prevent unacceptable risks to people and the environment from the use of pest control products,</p><p class="indent-1-1">the attainment of the objectives of the federal regulatory system continue to be pursued through a scientifically-based national registration system that addresses risks to human health and the environment both before and after registration and applies to the regulation of pest control products throughout Canada,</p><p class="indent-1-1">pest control products of acceptable risk be registered for use only if it is shown that their use would be efficacious and if conditions of registration can be established to prevent adverse health impact or pollution of the environment,</p><p class="indent-1-1">in assessing risks to humans, consideration be given to aggregate exposure to pest control products, cumulative effects of pest control products and the different sensitivities to pest control products of major identifiable subgroups, including pregnant women, infants, children, women and seniors,</p><p class="indent-1-1">pest control products be regulated in a manner that supports sustainable development, being development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,</p><p class="indent-1-1">the federal regulatory system be designed to minimize health and environmental risks posed by pest control products and to encourage the development and implementation of innovative, sustainable pest management strategies, for example by facilitating access to pest control products that pose lower risks, and encouraging the development and use of alternative, non-toxic, ecological pest control approaches, strategies and products,</p><p class="indent-1-1">applicable policies of the Government of Canada that are consistent with the objectives of this Act be duly reflected in decisions respecting the regulation of pest control products,</p><p class="indent-1-1">there be cooperation among federal departments in the development of policies to pursue the attainment of the objectives of this Act, and that those policies take into account advice from diverse sources throughout the country,</p><p class="indent-1-1">the provinces and territories and those whose interests and concerns are affected by the federal regulatory system be accorded a reasonable opportunity to participate in the regulatory system in ways that are consistent with the attainment of its objectives, and</p><p class="indent-1-1">the federal regulatory system be administered efficiently and effectively in accordance with the foregoing principles and objectives and in a manner that recognizes the various interests and concerns affected and, where consistent with the primary objective of the system, minimizes the negative impact on economic viability and competitiveness;</p><p class="indent-1-0">AND WHEREAS Canada must be able to fulfil its international obligations in relation to pest management;</p></section><div class="Enacts"><p

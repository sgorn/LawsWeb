It also amends that Act to modify the Employment Insurance premium rate-setting mechanism, including setting the 2015 and 2016 rates and requiring that the rate be set on a seven-year break-even basis by the Canada Employment Insurance Commission beginning with the 2017 rate. The Division repeals the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-4.4">Canada Employment Insurance Financing Board Act</a></cite> and related provisions of other Acts. Lastly, it makes technical amendments to the <cite class="XRefExternalRegulation"><a href="/eng/regulations/SOR-96-445">Employment Insurance (Fishing) Regulations</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 2 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/T-19.8">Trust and Loan Companies Act</a></cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/B-1.01">Bank Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-11.8">Insurance Companies Act</a></cite> to remove the prohibition against federal and provincial Crown agents and federal and provincial government employees being directors of a federally regulated financial institution. It also amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/O-2.7">Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/F-11.1">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act</a></cite> to remove the obligation of certain persons to give the Minister of Finance notice of their intent to borrow money from a federally regulated financial institution or from a corporation that has deposit insurance under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-3">Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 3 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/T-19.8">Trust and Loan Companies Act</a></cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/B-1.01">Bank Act</a></cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-11.8">Insurance Companies Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-41.01">Cooperative Credit Associations Act</a></cite> to clarify the rules for certain indirect acquisitions of foreign financial institutions.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 4 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-46">Criminal Code</a></cite> to update the definition <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“passport”</dfn></span> in subsection 57(5) and also amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/F-27.5">Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Act</a></cite> to update the reference to the Minister in paragraph 11(1)(<em>a</em>).</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 5 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/L-2">Canada Labour Code</a></cite> to amend the definition of <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“danger”</dfn></span> in subsection 122(1), to modify the refusal to work process, to remove all references to health and safety officers and to confer on the Minister of Labour their powers, duties and functions. It also makes consequential amendments to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/N-7">National Energy Board Act</a></cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/H-2.7">Hazardous Materials Information Review Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/N-23.6">Non-smokers’ Health Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 6 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/H-5.7">Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act</a></cite> to change the name of the Department to the Department of Employment and Social Development and to reflect that name change in the title of that Act and of its responsible Minister. In addition, the Division amends Part 6 of that Act to extend that Minister’s powers with respect to certain Acts, programs and activities and to allow the Minister of Labour to administer or enforce electronically the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/L-2">Canada Labour Code</a></cite>. The Division also adds the title of a Minister to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-3">Salaries Act</a></cite>. Finally, it makes consequential amendments to several other Acts to reflect the name change.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 7 of Part 3 authorizes Her Majesty in right of Canada to hold, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Dominion Coal Blocks in any manner.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 8 of Part 3 authorizes the amalgamation of four Crown corporations that own or operate international bridges and gives the resulting amalgamated corporation certain powers. It also makes consequential amendments and repeals certain Acts.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 9 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/F-11">Financial Administration Act</a></cite> to provide that agent corporations designated by the Minister of Finance may, subject to any terms and conditions of the designation, pledge any securities or cash that they hold, or give deposits, as security for the payment or performance of obligations arising out of derivatives that they enter into or guarantee for the management of financial risks.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 10 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/N-15">National Research Council Act</a></cite> to reduce the number of members of the National Research Council of Canada and to create the position of Chairperson of the Council.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 11 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/V-1.6">Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act</a></cite> to reduce the permanent number of members of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 12 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-8.3">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act</a></cite> to allow for the appointment of up to three directors who are not residents of Canada.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 13 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-24.501">Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act</a></cite> to extend to the whole Act the protection for communications that are subject to solicitor-client privilege and to provide that information disclosed by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada under subsection 65(1) of that Act may be used by a law enforcement agency referred to in that subsection only as evidence of a contravention of Part 1 of that Act.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 14 of Part 3 enacts the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Mackenzie Gas Project Impacts Fund Act</cite>, which establishes the Mackenzie Gas Project Impacts Fund. The Division also repeals the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/M-0.1">Mackenzie Gas Project Impacts Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 15 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-36.65">Conflict of Interest Act</a></cite> to allow the Governor in Council to designate a person or class of persons as public office holders and to designate a person who is a public office holder or a class of persons who are public office holders as reporting public office holders, for the purposes of that Act.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 16 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-2.5">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></cite> to establish a new regime that provides that a foreign national who wishes to apply for permanent residence as a member of a certain economic class may do so only if they have submitted an expression of interest to the Minister and have subsequently been issued an invitation to apply.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 17 of Part 3 modernizes the collective bargaining and recourse systems provided by the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-33.3">Public Service Labour Relations Act</a></cite> regime. It amends the dispute resolution process for collective bargaining by removing the choice of dispute resolution method and substituting conciliation, which involves the possibility of the use of a strike as the method by which the parties may resolve impasses. In those cases where 80% or more of the positions in a bargaining unit are considered necessary for providing an essential service, the dispute resolution mechanism is to be arbitration. The collective bargaining process is further streamlined through amendments to the provision dealing with essential services. The employer has the exclusive right to determine that a service is essential and the numbers of positions that will be required to provide that service. Bargaining agents are to be consulted as part of the essential services process. The collective bargaining process is also amended by extending the timeframe within which a notice to bargain collectively may be given before the expiry of a collective agreement or arbitral award.</p><p class="indent-1-0">In addition, the Division amends the factors that arbitration boards and public interest commissions must take into account when making awards or reports, respectively. It also amends the processes for the making of those awards and reports and removes the compensation analysis and research function from the mandate of the Public Service Labour Relations Board.</p><p class="indent-1-0">The Division streamlines the recourse process set out for grievances and complaints in Part 2 of the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-33.3">Public Service Labour Relations Act</a></cite> and for staffing complaints under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-33.01">Public Service Employment Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">The Division also establishes a single forum for employees to challenge decisions relating to discrimination in the public service. Grievances and complaints are to be heard by the Public Service Labour Relations Board under the grievance process set out in the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-33.3">Public Service Labour Relations Act</a></cite>. The process for the review of those grievances or complaints is to be the same as the one that currently exists under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/H-6">Canadian Human Rights Act</a></cite>. However, grievances and complaints related specifically to staffing complaints are to be heard by the Public Service Staffing Tribunal. Grievances relating to discrimination are required to be submitted within one year or any longer period that the Public Service Labour Relations Board considers appropriate, to reflect what currently exists under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/H-6">Canadian Human Rights Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Furthermore, the Division amends the grievance recourse process in several ways. With the sole exception of grievances relating to issues of discrimination, employees included in a bargaining unit may only present or refer an individual grievance to adjudication if they have the approval of and are represented by their bargaining agent. Also, the process as it relates to policy grievances is streamlined, including by defining more clearly an adjudicator’s remedial power when dealing with a policy grievance.</p><p class="indent-1-0">In addition, the Division provides for a clearer apportionment of the expenses of adjudication relating to the interpretation of a collective agreement. They are to be borne in equal parts by the employer and the bargaining agent. If a grievance relates to a deputy head’s direct authority, such as with respect to discipline, termination of employment or demotion, the expenses are to be borne in equal parts by the deputy head and the bargaining agent. The expenses of adjudication for employees who are not represented by a bargaining agent are to be borne by the Public Service Labour Relations Board.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Finally, the Division amends the recourse process for staffing complaints under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-33.01">Public Service Employment Act</a></cite> by ensuring that the right to complain is triggered only in situations when more than one employee participates in an exercise to select employees that are to be laid off. And, candidates who are found not to meet the qualifications set by a deputy head may only complain with respect to their own assessment.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 18 of Part 3 establishes the Public Service Labour Relations and Employment Board to replace the Public Service Labour Relations Board and the Public Service Staffing Tribunal. The new Board will deal with matters that were previously dealt with by those former Boards under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-33.3">Public Service Labour Relations Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/P-33.01">Public Service Employment Act</a></cite>, respectively, which will permit proceedings under those Acts to be consolidated.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 19 of Part 3 adds declaratory provisions to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-26">Supreme Court Act</a></cite>, respecting the criteria for appointing judges to the Supreme Court of Canada.</p></section><div class="Enacts"><p class="indent-1-0">Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:</p></div><h1 class="Part" id="h-1"><span class="HTitleText1">SHORT TITLE</span></h1><!--#include file="content-section-1.html" --><h1 class="Part" id="h-2"><span class="HLabel1">PART 1</span><span class="HTitleText1">MEASURES RELATING TO INCOME TAX</span></h1><h2 class="Subheading" id="h-3"><span class="MarginalNoteInHeading">R.S., c. 1 (5th Supp.)</span><span class="HTitleText2"><cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-3.3">Income Tax Act</a></cite></span></h2><!--#include file="content-section-2.html" --><!--#include file="content-section-3.html" --><!--#include file="content-section-4.html" --><!--#include file="content-section-5.html" --></section></div>

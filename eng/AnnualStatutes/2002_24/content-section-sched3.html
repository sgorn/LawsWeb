in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an

However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly to the business of that enterprise, such agent shall not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">III.

the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of

between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph l after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after five years from the end of the year in which the profits which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph l, have been attributed to that enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (<em>a</em>), 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if they are paid by a non-resident owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada to a company that is a resident of the United Arab Emirates and that holds directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“dividends”</dfn></span> as used in this Article means income from shares, “<span class="otherLang" lang="fr">jouissance</span>” shares or “<span class="otherLang" lang="fr">jouissance</span>” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.

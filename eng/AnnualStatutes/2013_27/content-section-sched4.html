Any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed five per cent of the amount of those earnings that have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the earnings attributable to the alienation of such immovable property situated in a Party as may be taxed by that Party under the provisions of Article 6 (Income from Immovable Property) or of paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Capital Gains), and the profits, including any gains, attributable to a permanent establishment in a Party in a year and previous years, after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on those profits in that Party.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. A resident of a Party shall not be entitled to any benefits provided under this Article in respect of a dividend if one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment or transfer of the dividend, or with the creation, assignment, acquisition or transfer of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or with the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the person that is the beneficial owner of the dividend, is for that resident to obtain the benefits of this Article.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Party and paid to a resident of the other Party may be taxed in that other Party.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Party in which it arises and according to the laws of that Party, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Party, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interest arising in a Party and paid to the Government of the other Party, or to a political subdivision or a local authority of that other Party, shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned Party;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest arising in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by Export Development Canada;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) interest arising in Canada and paid to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority shall be taxable only in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) interest arising in a Party and paid to any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of the other Party, political subdivision or local authority, shall be taxable only in that other Party.

However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 8 (Shipping and Air Transport) or Article 10 (Dividends).</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Party, carries on business in the other Party in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.

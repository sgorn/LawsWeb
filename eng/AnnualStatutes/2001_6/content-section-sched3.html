and quality.</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consolidate goods, the number of packages or units enumerated in the bill of lading as packed in such article of transport shall be deemed the number of packages or units for the purpose of this paragraph as far as these packages or units are concerned.

The calculation and the conversion mentioned in the preceding sentences shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of that State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in sub-paragraph (<em>a</em>) of paragraph 5 of this Article as is expressed there in units of account.</p><p class="indent-0-0">States shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation or the result of the conversion as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification of the Protocol of 1979 or of accession thereto and whenever there is a change in either.</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>e</em>) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this paragraph if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>f</em>) The declaration mentioned in sub-paragraph (<em>a</em>) of this paragraph, if embodied in the bill of lading, shall be <span class="otherLang" lang="la">prima facie</span> evidence, but shall not be binding or conclusive on the carrier.</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>g</em>) By agreement between the carrier, master or agent of the carrier and the shipper other maximum amounts than those mentioned in sub-paragraph (<em>a</em>) of this paragraph may be fixed, provided that no maximum amount so fixed shall be less than the appropriate maximum mentioned in that sub-paragraph.</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>h</em>) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to, or in connection with, goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowingly mis-stated by the shipper in the bill of lading.</p><p class="indent-1-0">6. Goods of an inflammable, explosive or dangerous nature to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier has not consented, with knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment.</p><p class="indent-0-0">If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general average, if any.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article IV <span class="otherLang" lang="la">BIS</span><br>Application of Defences and Limits of Liability</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. The defences and limits of liability provided for in these Rules shall apply in any action against the carrier in respect of loss or damage to goods covered by a contract of carriage whether the action be founded in contract or in tort.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. If such an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier (such servant or agent not being an independent contractor), such servant or agent shall be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier is entitled to invoke under these Rules.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, and such servants and agents, shall in no case exceed the limit provided for in these Rules.</p><p class="indent-1-0">4. Nevertheless, a servant or agent of the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this Article, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article  V<br>Surrender of Rights and Immunities, and Increase of Responsibilities and Liabilities</h3><p class="indent-1-0">A carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and liabilities under the Rules contained in any of these Articles, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the bill of lading issued to the shipper.</p><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of these Rules shall not be applicable to charter-parties, but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship under a charter-party they shall comply with the terms of these Rules. Nothing in these Rules shall be held to prevent the insertion in a bill of lading of any lawful provision regarding general average.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article VI<br>Special Conditions</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Articles, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier and a shipper shall in regard to any particular goods be at liberty to enter into any agreement in any terms as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the rights and immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his obligation as to seaworthiness, so far as this stipulation is not contrary to public policy, or the care or diligence of his servants or agents in regard to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of the goods carried by water, provided that in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the terms agreed shall be embodied in a receipt which shall be a non-negotiable document and shall be marked as such.</p><p class="indent-0-0">Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect.</p><p class="indent-0-0">Provided that this Article shall not apply to ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade, but only to other shipments where the character or condition of the property to be carried or the circumstances, terms and conditions under which the carriage is to be performed are such as reasonably to justify a special agreement.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article  VII<br>Limitations on the Application of the Rules</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Nothing herein contained shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reservation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to, or in connection with the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by water.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article VIII<br>Limitation of Liability</h3><p class="indent-1-0">The provisions of these Rules shall not affect the rights and obligations of the carrier under any statute for the time being in force relating to the limitation of the liability of owners of vessels.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article IX<br>Liability for Nuclear Damage</h3><p class="indent-1-0">These Rules shall not affect the provisions of any international Convention or national law governing liability for nuclear damage.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article  X<br>Application</h3><p class="indent-1-0">The provisions of these Rules shall apply to every bill of lading relating to the carriage of goods between ports in two different States if:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) the bill of lading is issued in a Contracting State, or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the carriage is from a port in a Contracting State, or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) the contract contained in or evidenced by the bill of lading provides that these Rules or legislation of any State giving effect to them are to govern the contract,</p><p class="indent-0-0">whatever may be the nationality of the ship, the carrier, the shipper, the consignee, or any other interested person.</p></div></section>

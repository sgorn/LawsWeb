The fund can be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the legislation of the Contracting State where the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequate by the Court or other competent authority.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts of their established claims.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of his servants or agents or any person providing him insurance or other financial security has as a result of the incident in question, paid compensation for pollution damage, such person shall, up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article may also be exercised by a person other than those mentioned therein in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution damage which he may have paid but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where the owner or any other person establishes that he may be compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such amount of compensation, with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of subrogation under paragraphs 5 or 6 of this Article, had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the Court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">8. Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or sacrifices reasonably made by the owner voluntarily to prevent or minimize pollution damage shall rank equally with other claims against the fund.</p></li></ul><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">9. (<em>a</em>) The <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“unit of account”</dfn></span> referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund.

The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) Nevertheless, a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 9(<em>a</em>) may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the unit of account referred to in paragraph 9(<em>a</em>) shall be equal to 15 gold francs.

Contracting States shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 9(<em>a</em>), or the result of the conversion in paragraph 9(<em>b</em>) as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">10. For the purpose of this Article the ship’s tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations contained in Annex I of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">11. The insurer or other person providing financial security shall be entitled to constitute a fund in accordance with this Article on the same conditions and having the same effect as if it were constituted by the owner.

With respect to a ship registered in a Contracting State such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship’s registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a Contracting State it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any Contracting State. This certificate shall be in the form of the annexed model and shall contain the following particulars:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) name of ship and port of registration;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) name and principal place of business of owner;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) type of security;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) name and principal place of business of insurer or other person giving security and, where appropriate, place of business where the insurance or security is established;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>e</em>) period of validity of certificate which shall not be longer than the period of validity of the insurance or other security.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing State. If the language used is neither English nor French, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship’s registry or, if the ship is not registered in a Contracting State, with the authorities of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate under paragraph 2 of this Article, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or security no longer satisfying the requirements of this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. The State of registry shall, subject to the provisions of this Article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a Contracting State in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be accepted by other Contracting States for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other Contracting States as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a Contracting State. A Contracting State may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">8. Any claim for compensation for pollution damage may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security for the owner’s liability for pollution damage. In such case the defendant may, even if the owner is not entitled to limit his liability according to Article V, paragraph 2, avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Article V, paragraph 1. He may further avail himself of the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up of the owner) which the owner himself would have been entitled to invoke. Furthermore, the defendant may avail himself of the defence that the pollution damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the owner himself, but the defendant shall not avail himself of any other defence which he might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the owner against him. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the owner to be joined in the proceedings.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">9. Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">10. A Contracting State shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this Article applies to trade unless a certificate has been issued under paragraph 2 or 12 of this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">11. Subject to the provisions of this Article, each Contracting State shall ensure, under its national legislation, that insurance or other security to the extent specified in paragraph 1 of this Article is in force in respect of any ship, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving an off-shore terminal in its territorial sea, if the ship actually carries more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">12. If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a Contracting State, the provisions of this Article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship’s registry stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the ship’s liability is covered within the limits prescribed by Article V, paragraph 1. Such a certificate shall follow as closely as practicable the model prescribed by paragraph 2 of this Article.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">ARTICLE VIII<br></h2><p class="indent-1-0">Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be extinguished unless an action is brought thereunder within three years from the date when the damage occurred. However, in no case shall an action be brought after six years from the date of the incident which caused the damage. Where this incident consists of a series of occurrences, the six years’ period shall run from the date of the first such occurrence.</p><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">ARTICLE IX<br></h2><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where an incident has caused pollution damage in the territory, including the territorial sea or an area referred to in Article II, of one or more Contracting States or preventive measures have been taken to prevent or minimize pollution damage in such territory including the territorial sea or area, actions for compensation may only be brought in the Courts of any such Contracting State or States. Reasonable notice of any such action shall be given to the defendant.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Each Contracting State shall ensure that its Courts possess the necessary jurisdiction to entertain such actions for compensation.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. After the fund has been constituted in accordance with Article V the Courts of the State in which the fund is constituted shall be exclusively competent to determine all matters relating to the apportionment and distribution of the fund.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">ARTICLE X<br></h2><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Any judgment given by a Court with jurisdiction in accordance with Article IX which is enforceable in the State of origin where it is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, shall be recognized in any Contracting State, except:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) where the judgment was obtained by fraud; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) where the defendant was not given reasonable notice and a fair opportunity to present his case.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. A judgment recognized under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be enforceable in each Contracting State as soon as the formalities required in that State have been complied with.

However, where an action for compensation for pollution damage under the 1992 Liability Convention has been brought before a court in a State Party to the 1992 Liability Convention but not to this Convention, any action against the Fund under Article 4 of this Convention shall at the option of the claimant be brought either before a court of the State where the Fund has its headquarters or before any court of a State Party to this Convention competent under Article IX of the 1992 Liability Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Each Contracting State shall ensure that the Fund shall have the right to intervene as a party to any legal proceedings instituted in accordance with Article IX of the 1992 Liability Convention before a competent court of that State against the owner of a ship or his guarantor.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 6, the Fund shall not be bound by any judgment or decision in proceedings to which it has not been a party or by any settlement to which it is not a party.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 4, where an action under the 1992 Liability Convention for compensation for pollution damage has been brought against an owner or his guarantor before a competent court in a Contracting State, each party to the proceedings shall be entitled under the national law of that State to notify the Fund of the proceedings. Where such notification has been made in accordance with the formalities required by the law of the court seized and in such time and in such a manner that the Fund has in fact been in a position effectively to intervene as a party to the proceedings, any judgment rendered by the court in such proceedings shall, after it has become final and enforceable in the State where the judgment was given, become binding upon the Fund in the sense that the facts and findings in that judgment may not be disputed by the Fund even if the Fund has not actually intervened in the proceedings.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br></h3><p class="indent-1-0">Subject to any decision concerning the distribution referred to in Article 4, paragraph 5, any judgment given against the Fund by a court having jurisdiction in accordance with Article 7, paragraphs 1 and 3, shall, when it has become enforceable in the State of origin and is in that State no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, be recognized and enforceable in each Contracting State on the same conditions as are prescribed in Article X of the 1992 Liability Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br></h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The Fund shall, in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution damage paid by the Fund in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 1, of this Convention, acquire by subrogation the rights that the person so compensated may enjoy under the 1992 Liability Convention against the owner or his guarantor.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of recourse or subrogation of the Fund against persons other than those referred to in the preceding paragraph. In any event the right of the Fund to subrogation against such person shall not be less favourable than that of an insurer of the person to whom compensation has been paid.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Without prejudice to any other rights of subrogation or recourse against the Fund which may exist, a Contracting State or agency thereof which has paid compensation for pollution damage in accordance with provisions of national law shall acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CONTRIBUTIONS</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br></h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Annual contributions to the Fund shall be made in respect of each Contracting State by any person who, in the calendar year referred to in Article 12, paragraph 2(<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>), has received in total quantities exceeding 150,000 tons:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in the ports or terminal installations in the territory of that State contributing oil carried by sea to such ports or terminal installations; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) in any installations situated in the territory of that Contracting State contributing oil which has been carried by sea and discharged in a port or terminal installation of a non-Contracting State, provided that contributing oil shall only be taken into account by virtue of this sub-paragraph on first receipt in a Contracting State after its discharge in that non-Contracting State.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">2. (<em>a</em>) For the purposes of paragraph 1, where the quantity of contributing oil received in the territory of a Contracting State by any person in a calendar year when aggregated with the quantity of contributing oil received in the same Contracting State in that year by any associated person or persons exceeds 150,000 tons, such person shall pay contributions in respect of the actual quantity received by him notwithstanding that that quantity did not exceed 150,000 tons.</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“Associated person”</dfn></span> means any subsidiary or commonly controlled entity.

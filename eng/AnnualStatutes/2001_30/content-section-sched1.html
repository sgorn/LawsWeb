The method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br>Shipping and Air Transport</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and of Article 7, profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from a voyage of a ship or aircraft where the principal purpose of the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. In this Article, the term “operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic” by an enterprise, includes the charter or rental of ships or aircraft, and the rental of containers and related equipment, by that enterprise provided that such charter or rental is incidental to the operation by that enterprise of ships or aircraft in international traffic.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br>Associated Enterprises</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,</p><p class="indent-0-0">and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its national laws and, in any case, after six years from the end of the year in which the profits which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) except in the case of dividends paid by a non-resident-owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada, 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends where that company is a resident of Canada;</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends where that company is a resident of Slovenia;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, a tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a national of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the profits, including any gains, attributable to a permanent establishment in a Contracting State in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits by that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. The provisions of paragraph 6 shall also apply with respect to earnings derived from the alienation of immovable property in one of the Contracting States by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property, whether or not it has a permanent establishment in that State, but only insofar as these earnings may be taxed by that State under the provisions of Article 6 or paragraph 1 of Article 13.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid in respect of indebtedness of the government of that State or of a political subdivision or local authority thereof shall, provided that the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, be taxable only in that other State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest arising in Slovenia and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Export Development Corporation;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of Slovenia shall be taxable only in Slovenia if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Slovenian Export Company (<em>Slovenska izvozna druzba</em>); and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State which was constituted and is operated exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more pension, retirement or other employee benefits plans shall not be taxable in the first-mentioned State provided that:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the resident is the beneficial owner of the interest and is generally exempt from tax in the other State; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the interest is not derived from carrying on a trade or a business or from a related person.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 10. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purposes of this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the payer is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 12<br>Royalties</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the royalties the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including payments of any kind in respect of motion picture films and works on film, videotape, tape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television or radio, for the use of, or the right to use any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process or other intangible property, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.

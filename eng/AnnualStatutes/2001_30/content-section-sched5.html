In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, a tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a national of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in the case of Senegal, sixteen per cent (16%),</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) in the case of Canada, fifteen per cent (15%)</p><p class="indent-0-0">of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “earnings” means the profits, including any gains, attributable to a permanent establishment situated in a Contracting State in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits by that State.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. The provisions of paragraph 6 shall also apply with respect to earnings derived from the alienation of immovable property situated in a Contracting State by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property, whether or not it has a permanent establishment in that State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in the case of Senegal, twenty per cent (20%) of the gross amount of the interest on “<em>bons de caisse</em>” and sixteen per cent (16%) of their gross amount in all other cases;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) in the case of Canada, fifteen per cent (15%) of the gross amount of the interest in all cases.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid in respect of indebtedness of the government of that State or of a political subdivision or local authority thereof shall, provided that the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, be taxable only in that other State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest arising in Senegal and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended or insured by the Export Development Corporation;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of Senegal shall be taxable only in Senegal if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by an appropriate Senegalese institution as is specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the taxation laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 10.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the payer is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 12<br>Royalties</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed fifteen per cent (15%) of the gross amount of the royalties.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, and includes payments of any kind in respect of motion picture films and works on film, videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State.

the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br>Shipping and Air Transport</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and of Article 7, profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft used principally to transport passengers or goods exclusively between places in a Contracting State may be taxed in that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits derived by a resident of a Contracting State from its participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) profits from the rental on a bare boat basis of ships or aircraft and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods,</p><p class="indent-0-0">where such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br>Associated Enterprises</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,</p><p class="indent-0-0">and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after five years from the end of the year in which the profits which would be subject to such change would have accrued to an enterprise of that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) except in the case of dividends paid by a non-resident-owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada, 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the alienation of immovable property situated in that State by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property or on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the earnings attributable to the alienation of such immovable property situated in a Contracting State as may be taxed by that State under the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 13, and the profits, including any gains from the alienation of any property, attributable to a permanent establishment in a Contracting State in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits by that State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid in respect of indebtedness of the government of that Contracting State or of a political subdivision or local authority thereof shall, provided that the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, be taxable only in that other State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by an entity wholly-owned and controlled by the government of that other State, provided this loan or credit is in respect of imports or exports;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State, beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State and paid in connection with the sale on credit of any equipment, merchandise or services except where the sale is made between persons not dealing with each other at arm’s length, shall be taxable only in that other State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State which was constituted and is operated exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more pension, retirement or other employee benefits plans shall not be taxable in the first-mentioned State provided that</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the resident is the beneficial owner of the interest and is generally exempt from tax in the other State, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the interest is not derived from carrying on a business or from an associated person within the meaning of subparagraph (<em>a</em>) or subparagraph (<em>b</em>) of paragraph 1 of Article 9.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 10.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the payer is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

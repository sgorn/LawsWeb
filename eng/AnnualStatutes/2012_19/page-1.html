Most notably, it</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-3.3">Income Tax Act</a></cite> consequential on the implementation of the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/M-1.5">Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act</a></cite>, including the extension of the tax deferral allowed to farmers in a designated area who produce listed grains and receive deferred cash purchase tickets to all Canadian farmers who produce listed grains and receive deferred cash purchase tickets;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) provides authority for the Canada Revenue Agency to issue via online notice or regular mail demands to file a return; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) introduces a requirement for commercial tax preparers to file income tax returns electronically.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-1-0">Part 2 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-15">Excise Tax Act</a></cite> to implement certain excise tax and goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) measures proposed in the March 29, 2012 Budget. It expands the list of GST/HST zero-rated medical and assistive devices as well as the list of GST/HST zero-rated non-prescription drugs that are used to treat life-threatening diseases. It also exempts certain pharmacists’ professional services from the GST/HST, other than prescription drug dispensing services that are already zero-rated. It further allows certain literacy organizations to claim a rebate of the GST and the federal component of the HST paid on the acquisition of books to be given away for free by those organizations. It also implements legislative requirements relating to the Government of British Columbia’s decision to exit the harmonized sales tax framework. Additional amendments to that Act and related regulations in respect of foreign-based rental vehicles temporarily imported by Canadian residents provide, in certain circumstances, relief from the GST/HST, the Green Levy on fuel-inefficient vehicles and the automobile air conditioner tax. This Part further amends that Act to ensure that changes to the standardized fuel consumption test method used for the EnerGuide, as announced on February 17, 2012 by the Minister of Natural Resources, do not affect the application of the Green Levy.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Finally, Part 2 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/A-10.5">Air Travellers Security Charge Act</a></cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-14.1">Excise Act, 2001</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-15">Excise Tax Act</a></cite> to provide authority for the Canada Revenue Agency to issue via online notice or regular mail demands to file a return.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 3 contains certain measures related to responsible resource development.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 1 of Part 3 enacts the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</cite>, which establishes a new federal environmental assessment regime.

At the end of an assessment, a decision statement is to be issued to the project proponent who is required to comply with the conditions set out in it.</p><p class="indent-1-0">The enactment provides for cooperation between the federal government and other jurisdictions by enabling the delegation of an environmental assessment, the substitution of the process of another jurisdiction for an environmental assessment under the Act and the exclusion of a project from the application of the Act when there is an equivalent assessment by another jurisdiction. The enactment requires that there be opportunities for public participation during an environmental assessment, that participant funding programs and a public registry be established, and that there be follow-up programs in relation to all environmental assessments. It also provides for powers of inspection and fines.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Finally, the enactment specifies that federal authorities are not to take certain measures regarding the carrying out of projects on federal lands or outside Canada unless they determine that those projects are not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.</p><p class="indent-1-0">This Division also makes related amendments to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-12.5">Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act</a></cite> and consequential amendments to other Acts, and repeals the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-15.2">Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</a></cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Division 2 of Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/N-7">National Energy Board Act</a></cite> to allow the Governor in Council to make the decision about the issuance of certificates for major pipelines.

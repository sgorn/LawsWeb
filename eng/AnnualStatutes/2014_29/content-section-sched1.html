The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or security no longer satisfying the requirements of this article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. The State of the ship’s registry shall, subject to the provisions of this article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the compulsory insurance certificate.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Compulsory insurance certificates issued or certified under the authority of a State Party in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be accepted by other States Parties for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other States Parties as having the same force as compulsory insurance certificates issued or certified by them even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a State Party. A State Party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the compulsory insurance certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">8. Any claim for compensation for damage may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security for the owner’s liability for damage. In such case the defendant may, even if the owner is not entitled to limitation of liability, benefit from the limit of liability prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. The defendant may further invoke the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up of the owner) which the owner would have been entitled to invoke. Furthermore, the defendant may invoke the defence that the damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the owner, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the owner against the defendant. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the owner to be joined in the proceedings.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">9. Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">10. A State Party shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this article applies to trade unless a certificate has been issued under paragraph 2 or 12.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">11. Subject to the provisions of this article, each State Party shall ensure, under its national law, that insurance or other security in the sums specified in paragraph 1 is in force in respect of any ship, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving an offshore facility in its territorial sea.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">12. If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a State Party, the provisions of this article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a compulsory insurance certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship’s registry stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the ship’s liability is covered within the limit prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. Such a compulsory insurance certificate shall follow as closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Chapter III<br>Compensation by the International Hazardous and Noxious Substances Fund (HNS Fund)</h3><h4 class="SchedHeadL3">Establishment of the HNS Fund<br>Article 13</h4><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The International Hazardous and Noxious Substances Fund (HNS Fund) is hereby established with the following aims:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) to provide compensation for damage in connection with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances by sea, to the extent that the protection afforded by chapter II is inadequate or not available; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) to give effect to the related tasks set out in article 15.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The HNS Fund shall in each State Party be recognized as a legal person capable under the laws of that State of assuming rights and obligations and of being a party in legal proceedings before the courts of that State.

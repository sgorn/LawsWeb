<section class="summary"><h1 class="Summary">SUMMARY</h1><p class="indent-1-0">Part 1 of this enactment amends Part I of the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Federal Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act</cite> to authorize the Minister of Finance to make fiscal equalization payments to the provinces for each of the five fiscal years in the period beginning on April 1, 2004 and ending on March 31, 2009 and to change the manner in which those payments will be calculated. It also amends Part V.1 of that Act to increase the amount that Canada will pay under the Canada Social Transfer in respect of the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2004 and the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2005.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 2 makes a consequential amendment to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Canada Newfoundland Atlantic Accord Implementation Act</cite>.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 3 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-5.5">Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology Act</a></cite> and provides for the making of certain payments to a trust, the Province of Nova Scotia, the Province of Saskatchewan, the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development Technology and the Canada Health Infoway Inc.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 4 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-8">Canada Pension Plan</a></cite> to clarify the rules governing contributions to the Canada Pension Plan and refunds of amounts remitted in relation to employers' contributions and to allow for the reinstatement of certain disability benefits.</p><p class="indent-1-0">With respect to the rules governing contributions to the Canada Pension Plan, the amendments allow an employer who immediately succeeds another employer, in a year after 2003, as a result of a change in business structure to take into account amounts relating to the determination of the contributions for an employee of the predecessor employer in determining contributions for the employee of the successor employer. The amendments also provide for situations where self employed individuals become employees of a corporation controlled by them or vice versa.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Other amendments clarify the amount of annual employers' contributions required under the Act and specify that only amounts remitted in excess of the required amount may be refunded to the employer. Those amendments are deemed to have come into force on March 18, 2003.</p><p class="indent-1-0">With respect to reinstatement of disability benefits, the amendments allow for reinstatement of a disability pension that has ceased to be payable because a person has returned to work, if the person again becomes incapable of working within a two year period after the date when payment of the pension ceased. It also provides for reinstatement of a disabled contributor's child benefit to the child of a person whose disability pension is reinstated.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 5 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-5.6">Employment Insurance Act</a></cite> to provide the Governor in Council with the authority to set the employment insurance premium rate for 2005. It also amends that Act to effect amendments that are equivalent to those made in Part 4 to the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/C-8">Canada Pension Plan</a></cite> with respect to contributions in the event of business restructuring.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 6 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/F-2.2">Farm Credit Canada Act</a></cite> to increase the capital of Farm Credit Canada.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 7 amends the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-15">Excise Tax Act</a></cite> to implement the 100 percent rebate of the Goods and Services Tax and the federal component of the Harmonized Sales Tax for municipalities. It also amends the Act to make certain supplies of property and services made by municipalities taxable, to introduce new rules to modify the determination of the basic tax content of property of a municipality and to provide for the public disclosure of the amount of the incremental rebate paid to individual municipalities. Those amendments generally apply as of February 1, 2004.</p><p class="indent-1-0">Part 8 amends <cite class="XRefExternalAct">the Air Travellers Security Charge Act</cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-14">Excise Act</a></cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-14.1">Excise Act, 2001</a></cite>, the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/E-15">Excise Tax Act</a></cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Income Tax</cite> Act to implement a uniform 10 year limitation period for the collection of amounts payable or remittable under those Acts effective as of March 4, 2004 when those amendments were first publicly proposed. It stipulates that certain collection actions or events restart or extend the limitation period. It precludes any claim because of the timing of action taken before March 4, 2004 to collect a charge debt or tax debt under those Acts. It also provides for a 10 year limitation period to begin March 4, 2004 for all amounts unpaid or unremitted under those Acts on that date. In addition, it ensures that the 10 year limitation period begins on that date for any of those amounts that would otherwise be affected by a court order made after March 3, 2004 and before the amendments in this Part come into force, which is the day on which they receive royal assent.</p></section><div class="Enacts"><p class="indent-1-0">Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:</p></div><h1 class="Part" id="h-1"><span class="HTitleText1">SHORT TITLE</span></h1><!--#include file="content-section-1.html" --><h1 class="Part" id="h-2"><span class="HLabel1">PART 1</span><span class="MarginalNoteInHeading">R.S., c.

It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. For the purposes of this Convention, the expression international carriage means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two States Parties, or within the territory of a single State Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a State Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Carriage to be performed by several successive carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. This Convention applies also to carriage as set out in Chapter V, subject to the terms contained therein.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 2 — Carriage Performed by State and Carriage of Postal Items</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In the carriage of postal items, the carrier shall be liable only to the relevant postal administration in accordance with the rules applicable to the relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this Convention shall not apply to the carriage of postal items.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CHAPTER II<br>DOCUMENTATION AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE CARRIAGE OF PASSENGERS, BAGGAGE AND CARGO</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 3 — Passengers and Baggage</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. In respect of carriage of passengers, an individual or collective document of carriage shall be delivered containing:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) an indication of the places of departure and destination;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single State Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Any other means which preserves the information indicated in paragraph 1 may be substituted for the delivery of the document referred to in that paragraph.

The consignor must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and must reimburse any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. If it is impossible to carry out the instructions of the consignor, the carrier must so inform the consignor forthwith.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. If the carrier carries out the instructions of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt delivered to the latter, the carrier will be liable, without prejudice to its right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13.

However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage. In the case of unchecked baggage, including personal items, the carrier is liable if the damage resulted from its fault or that of its servants or agents.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. If the carrier admits the loss of the checked baggage, or if the checked baggage has not arrived at the expiration of twenty-one days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the passenger is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Unless otherwise specified, in this Convention the term “baggage” means both checked baggage and unchecked baggage.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 18 — Damage to Cargo</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the event which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent it proves that the destruction, or loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted from one or more of the following:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or its servants or agents;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) an act of war or an armed conflict;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The carriage by air within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article comprises the period during which the cargo is in the charge of the carrier.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by inland waterway performed outside an airport. If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air. If a carrier, without the consent of the consignor, substitutes carriage by another mode of transport for the whole or part of a carriage intended by the agreement between the parties to be carriage by air, such carriage by another mode of transport is deemed to be within the period of carriage by air.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 19 — Delay</h3><p class="indent-1-0">The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carrier shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 20 — Exoneration</h3><p class="indent-1-0">If the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he or she derives his or her rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage. When by reason of death or injury of a passenger compensation is claimed by a person other than the passenger, the carrier shall likewise be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the extent that it proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of that passenger. This Article applies to all the liability provisions in this Convention, including paragraph 1 of Article 21.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 21 — Compensation in Case of Death or Injury of Passengers</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. For damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 not exceeding 100 000 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger, the carrier shall not be able to exclude or limit its liability.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The carrier shall not be liable for damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 to the extent that they exceed for each passenger 100 000 Special Drawing Rights if the carrier proves that:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) such damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the carrier or its servants or agents; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) such damage was solely due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a third party.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 22 — Limits of Liability in Relation to Delay, Baggage and Cargo</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. In the case of damage caused by delay as specified in Article 19 in the carriage of persons, the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to 4 150 Special Drawing Rights.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In the carriage of baggage, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to 1 000 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger unless the passenger has made, at the time when the checked baggage was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the passenger's actual interest in delivery at destination.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the consignor's actual interest in delivery at destination.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. In the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay of part of the cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier's liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the destruction, loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same air waybill, or the same receipt or, if they were not issued, by the same record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The foregoing provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, its servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that such servant or agent was acting within the scope of its employment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. The limits prescribed in Article 21 and in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff, including interest. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 23 — Conversion of Monetary Units</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Convention shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgement. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgement, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier prescribed in Article 21 is fixed at a sum of 1 500 000 monetary units per passenger in judicial proceedings in their territories; 62 500 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 of Article 22; 15 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 2 of Article 22; and 250 monetary units per kilogramme with respect to paragraph 3 of Article 22. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this Article and the conversion method mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles 21 and 22 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1 of this Article. States Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2 of this Article as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 24 — Review of Limits</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 25 of this Convention and subject to paragraph 2 below, the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 21, 22 and 23 shall be reviewed by the Depositary at five-year intervals, the first such review to take place at the end of the fifth year following the date of entry into force of this Convention, or if the Convention does not enter into force within five years of the date it is first open for signature, within the first year of its entry into force, by reference to an inflation factor which corresponds to the accumulated rate of inflation since the previous revision or in the first instance since the date of entry into force of the Convention. The measure of the rate of inflation to be used in determining the inflation factor shall be the weighted average of the annual rates of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Indices of the States whose currencies comprise the Special Drawing Right mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 23.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. If the review referred to in the preceding paragraph concludes that the inflation factor has exceeded 10 per cent, the Depositary shall notify States Parties of a revision of the limits of liability. Any such revision shall become effective six months after its notification to the States Parties. If within three months after its notification to the States Parties a majority of the States Parties register their disapproval, the revision shall not become effective and the Depositary shall refer the matter to a meeting of the States Parties. The Depositary shall immediately notify all States Parties of the coming into force of any revision.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the procedure referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied at any time provided that one-third of the States Parties express a desire to that effect and upon condition that the inflation factor referred to in paragraph 1 has exceeded 30 per cent since the previous revision or since the date of entry into force of this Convention if there has been no previous revision. Subsequent reviews using the procedure described in paragraph 1 of this Article will take place at five-year intervals starting at the end of the fifth year following the date of the reviews under the present paragraph.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 25 — Stipulation on Limits</h3><p class="indent-1-0">A carrier may stipulate that the contract of carriage shall be subject to higher limits of liability than those provided for in this Convention or to no limits of liability whatsoever.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 26 — Invalidity of Contractual Provisions</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 27 — Freedom to Contract</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Nothing contained in this Convention shall prevent the carrier from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, from waiving any defences available under the Convention, or from laying down conditions which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 28 — Advance Payments</h3><p class="indent-1-0">In the case of aircraft accidents resulting in death or injury of passengers, the carrier shall, if required by its national law, make advance payments without delay to a natural person or persons who are entitled to claim compensation in order to meet the immediate economic needs of such persons. Such advance payments shall not constitute a recognition of liability and may be offset against any amounts subsequently paid as damages by the carrier.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 29 — Basis of Claims</h3><p class="indent-1-0">In the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.

In the case of delay, the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his or her disposal.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Every complaint must be made in writing and given or dispatched within the times aforesaid.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. If no complaint is made within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on its part.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 32 — Death of Person Liable</h3><p class="indent-1-0">In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his or her estate.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 33 — Jurisdiction</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of its principal place of business, or where it has a place of business through which the contract has been made or before the court at the place of destination.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In respect of damage resulting from the death or injury of a passenger, an action may be brought before one of the courts mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, or in the territory of a State Party in which at the time of the accident the passenger has his or her principal and permanent residence and to or from which the carrier operates services for the carriage of passengers by air, either on its own aircraft, or on another carrier's aircraft pursuant to a commercial agreement, and in which that carrier conducts its business of carriage of passengers by air from premises leased or owned by the carrier itself or by another carrier with which it has a commercial agreement.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. For the purposes of paragraph 2,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) “commercial agreement” means an agreement, other than an agency agreement, made between carriers and relating to the provision of their joint services for carriage of passengers by air;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) “principal and permanent residence” means the one fixed and permanent abode of the passenger at the time of the accident.

Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability exceeding the amounts referred to in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24. Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights or defences conferred by this Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination contemplated in Article 22 shall not affect the actual carrier unless agreed to by it.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 42 — Addressee of Complaints and Instructions</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Any complaint to be made or instruction to be given under this Convention to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the actual carrier.

any decrease in value of the remaining property of the owner or holder, as determined under section 27.</p></li></ul></li><li><h6 class="MarginalNote"><span class="wb-invisible">Marginal

is,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>a</em>) if an election is made under subsection (3) by the owner or holder of the interest or right, the time specified by the owner or

was sent to a person whose name is set out in the report of the Attorney General of Canada referred to in subsection 5(2) or who served an objection on the Minister under section 9 until a time more

interest or right is its market value, being the amount that would have been paid for the interest or right if, at the time of its taking, it had been sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.</p></li><li><h6 class="MarginalNote"><span class="wb-invisible">Marginal note:</span>If owner or holder required to give up occupation</h6><p class="Subsection">(3) If the owner or

give up occupation of the land, the value of the expropriated interest or right is the greater of</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>a</em>) the market value of that interest or right determined as set out in subsection (2), and</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>b</em>) the aggregate of</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Subparagraph">(i) the market value of that interest or right determined on the basis that the use to which the expropriated interest or right was being put at the time of its taking was its highest and best use, and</p></li><li><p

other structure erected on it that was specially designed for use for the purpose of a school, hospital, municipal institution or religious or charitable institution or for any similar purpose, the use of which building or other structure for that purpose by the owner or holder has been rendered impracticable as a result of the expropriation, the value of the expropriated interest or right is, if that interest or right was and, but for the expropriation, would have continued to be used for that purpose and at the time of its taking there was no general demand or market for that interest or right for that purpose, the greater of</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>a</em>) the market value of the expropriated interest or right determined as set out in subsection

immovable real right for that purpose, and</p></li><li><p class="Subparagraph">(ii) the cost, expenses and losses arising out of or incidental to moving to and re-establishment on other premises, but if those costs, expenses and losses cannot practically be estimated or determined, there may instead be allowed a percentage, not exceeding 15, of the cost referred to in subparagraph (i),</p></li></ul><p class="ContinuedParagraph">minus the amount by which the owner or holder has improved, or may reasonably be expected to improve, their position through re-establishment on other premises.</p></li></ul></li><li><h6 class="MarginalNote"><span class="wb-invisible">Marginal note:</span>If Crown has taken physical possession of land</h6><p class="Subsection">(6) If the Crown has taken physical possession or made use of the parcel of land referred to in subsection (5) on the expiration of a period of notice to the owner or holder shorter than the 90 days mentioned in paragraph

(5)(<em>b</em>)(ii), consideration shall be given to the time and circumstances in which a former owner or holder was allowed to continue in occupation of the land after the Crown became entitled to take physical possession or make use of it, and to any assistance given by the Minister to enable the former owner or holder to seek and obtain alternative premises.</p></li><li><h6 class="MarginalNote"><span class="wb-invisible">Marginal note:</span>Land used for residence</h6><p class="Subsection">(8) If an expropriated interest or right was, immediately before the registration of a notice of confirmation, being used by its owner or holder for the purposes of their residence and the value of the interest or right otherwise determined under this section is less than the minimum amount sufficient to enable the owner or holder, at the earlier of</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>a</em>) the time of payment to them of any compensation in respect of the interest or right, otherwise than pursuant to any offer made to them under section 16, and</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>b</em>) the time when the Crown became entitled to take physical possession or make use of the land to the extent of the expropriated interest or right,</p></li></ul><p class="ContinuedSectionSubsection">to relocate their residence in or on premises reasonably

was, immediately before the registration of a notice of confirmation, owned or held by a lessee, there shall be substituted for the amount determined under subparagraph (3)(<em>b</em>)(ii) or (5)(<em>b</em>)(ii), or the amount by which the minimum amount referred to in subsection (8) exceeds the value of the interest or right referred to in the notice of confirmation otherwise determined under this section, as the case may be, any part of that amount that is appropriate having regard to</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>a</em>) the length of the term of the lease and the portion of the term remaining at the time at which the determination is relevant;</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph">(<em>b</em>) any right or reasonable prospect of renewal of the term

and</p></li><li><p class="Subparagraph">(ii) the amount of any loss or anticipated loss to the owner or holder of the expropriated interest or right resulting from a difference in rates of interest during the remainder of the period for which any principal amount payable under the terms of the security was advanced, that difference to be calculated on the basis of an assumed rate of interest not greater than the prevailing rate of interest for an equivalent security, to the extent that no other provision is made by this section for the inclusion of an amount in respect of the loss or anticipated loss in determining the value of the expropriated interest or right,</p></li></ul><p class="ContinuedParagraph">less the value of each security interest or real security to which the
